    <td> <p>Eclipse.org is the website of the Eclipse Foundation. </p>
      <p>Eclipse is an open platform for tool integration built by an open community 
        of tool providers. Operating under an open source paradigm, with a common 
        public license that provides royalty free source code and world wide redistribution 
        rights, the eclipse platform provides tool developers with ultimate flexibility 
        and control over their software technology.</p>
      <p>Eclipse has formed an independent open eco-system around royalty-free 
        technology and a universal platform for tools integration. Eclipse based 
        tools give developers freedom of choice in a multi-language, multi-platform, 
        multi-vendor environment. Eclipse provides a plug-in based framework that 
        makes it easier to create, integrate and utilize software tools, saving 
        time and money. By collaborating and exploiting core integration technology, 
        tool producers can leverage platform reuse and concentrate on core competencies 
        to create new development technology. The Eclipse Platform is written 
        in the Java language and comes with extensive plug-in construction toolkits 
        and examples. It has already been deployed on a range of development workstations 
        including Linux, HP-UX, AIX, Solaris, QNX, Mac OS X and Windows based 
        systems. A full description of the Eclipse community and white papers 
        documenting the design and use of the Eclipse Platform are available at 
        <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="_top">http://www.eclipse.org</a>.</p>
      <p>The Eclipse Foundation is a non-profit corporation formed to advance 
        the creation, evolution, promotion, and support of the Eclipse Platform 
        and to cultivate both an open source community and an ecosystem of complementary 
        products, capabilities, and services.</p>
      <p>You can learn more about the structure and mission of the Eclipse Foundation 
        by reading the <a href="documents/main.html">formal documents</a> that 
        establish how the foundation operates, and by reading the <a href="press-release/feb2004foundationpr.html">press

      <p>Industry leaders Borland, IBM, MERANT, QNX Software Systems, Rational 
        Software<SUP>3</SUP>, Red Hat, SuSE, TogetherSoft<SUP>3</SUP> and Webgain<SUP>2</SUP> 
        formed the initial eclipse.org Board of Stewards in November 2001. In 
        March of 2002, the board unanimously voted to add new members, Serena, 
        Sybase and Fujitsu. At the June 2002 meeting of the Board of Stewards, 
        Hitachi, Instantiations, MontaVista, Scapa Technologies and Telelogic 
        were added to the board membership. In September 2002, ETRI, HP, MKS and 
        SlickEdit were unanimously elected to the Board of Stewards. Also at the 
        September board meeting, Oracle's membership was approved. Catalyst Systems, 
        Flashline, Parasoft, SAP, teamstudio and TimeSys became members in December 
        2002. The board of stewards was very pleased to welcome the Object Management 
        Group (OMG) as an associate member. In March 2003 the board welcomed associate 
        member the Fraunhofer Institute, and stewards representing Ericsson, LogicLibrary, 
        M7 Corporation, QA Systems and SilverMark, Inc. We are now pleased to 
        include stewards from Advanced Systems Concepts, Genuitec and INNOOPRACT 
        Informationssysteme GmbH. In May of 2003 the board welcomed new members 
        CanyonBlue, Ensemble Systems, Intel, Micro Focus, Tensilica and Wasabi.</p>
 
	  <p> On Feb 2, 2004 the Eclipse Board of Stewards <a href="press-release/feb2004foundationpr.html">announced</a> 
        Eclipse's reorganization into a not-for-profit corporation. Originally 
        a consortium that formed when IBM released the Eclipse Platform into Open 
        Source, Eclipse became an independent body that will drive the platform&#8217;s 
        evolution to benefit the providers of software development offerings and 
        end-users. All technology and source code provided to this fast-growing 
        ecosystem will remain openly available and royalty-free.</p>
      <P>With this change, a full-time Eclipse management organization would be 
        established to engage with commercial developers and consumers, academic 
        and research institutions, standards bodies, tool interoperability groups 
        and individual developers, plus coordinate Open Source projects. To maintain 
        a reliable and accessible development roadmap, a set of councils&#8211;Requirements, 
        Architecture and Planning&#8211;will guide the development done by Eclipse 
        Open Source projects. With the support of over 50 member companies, Eclipse 
        already hosts 4 major Open Source projects that include 19 subprojects.<br>
      </p>
      <P> To oversee and staff this new management organization, Eclipse has established 
        a Board of Directors drawn from four classes of membership: Strategic 
        Developers, Strategic Consumers, Add-in Providers and Open Source project 
        leaders. </p>
      <p>Developers and Strategic Consumers hold seats on this Board, as do representatives 
        elected by Add-in Providers and Open Source project leaders. Strategic 
        Developers, Strategic Consumers and Add-in Providers contribute annual 
        dues. The founding Strategic Developers and Strategic Consumers are Ericsson, 
        HP, IBM, Intel, MontaVista Software, QNX, SAP and Serena Software. In 
        August 2004, Actuate joined the Eclipse Board as a Strategic Developer.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In the Eclipse Platform, code access and use is controlled through the 
        Common Public License<SUP>1</SUP>, which allows individuals to create 
        derivative works with worldwide re-distribution rights that are royalty 
        free. Those who use the Eclipse Platform may also want to use one or more 
        of the official Eclipse logos found on our <a href="../artwork/main.html">artwork
