      <P><b>Ottawa and Fremont, California, July 22, 2005</b> - The Eclipse Foundation, 
        an open source community committed to the development of a universal development 
        platform, and Versant Corporation (NASDAQ: VSNT), an industry leader in 
        specialized data management and data persistence software, today announced 
        that the JSR220-ORM Project proposed by Versant in March of this year 
        has been approved by Eclipse. The Eclipse JSR220-ORM Project will produce 
        standards-based, object-relational mapping design-time tooling in Eclipse. 
        JSR220 is the specification defining the standard for object-relational 
        mapping (ORM) in Java. Object-relational mapping has emerged in the last 
        year as a critical missing piece of software architecture in the drive 
        to make the Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) platform more powerful and 
        easier to program. The Eclipse JSR220-ORM Project is designed to bring 
        common tooling to the Java and Eclipse community to expand programming 
        productivity and the value of Eclipse.</p>
      <P>&quot;The creation of the JSR220-ORM project is an important milestone 
        for the Eclipse community&quot;, said Mike Milinkovich, executive director 
        of the Eclipse Foundation, Inc. &quot;This project will provide a common 
        framework for delivering productivity and consistency in the important 
        area of object-relational mapping.&quot;</p>
      <p>The goal of the JSR220-ORM Project is to provide visual development tools 
        that facilitate round-trip engineering when using the JSR 220 (EJB 3.0 
        persistence) and JSR 243 (Java Data Objects) approaches to persistence. 
        It will provide an implementation that is extensible to accommodate other 
        persistence standards and can be extended to generate artifacts for alternative 
        object-relational mapping runtimes. This project internally uses the Eclipse 
        Modeling Framework and the Eclipse Data Tools Project Schema Model for 
        consistency with the Eclipse framework, which eases integration and adoption 
        in other projects. </p>
      <p>&quot;I am pleased the JSR220-ORM Project is transitioning to this new 
        phase in the Eclipse development process,&quot; said Robert Greene, vice 
        president of product strategy at Versant. &quot;It solidifies Versant's 
        commitment to the Eclipse community and moves the Eclipse Platform one 
        step closer to providing important ORM tooling for this critical technology 
        segment,&quot; Greene added. &quot;The members of the JSR220-ORM Project 
        are looking forward to the first milestone release in early August when 
        the Eclipse community will be in a position to take advantage of this 
        new technology approach. The first milestone will deliver Forward, and 
        Meet-in-the-Middle mapping for JSR220 runtimes. Eclipse developers of 
        Java applications using relational database technology will finally begin 
        to enjoy the ease of development long promised in the emerging JSR220 
        specification.&quot;</p>
      <p>Robert Greene is the project lead for the Eclipse JSR220-ORM Project. 
        Scott Ambler, a leading authority on object-relational mapping has joined 
        the project as a developer and architectural advisor. Dirk Le Roux, a 
        committer on this project, was also approved as a committer to the Eclipse 
        Web Tools Platform Project acknowledging this project's code and architectural 
        contributions to the shared frameworks.</p>
      <p>&quot;The JSR220-ORM Project is an important new addition to the Eclipse 
        Technology Project,&quot; said John Graham, of Sybase, who is the Project 
        Management Committee lead for the Eclipse Data Tools Platform Project. 
        &quot;JSR220-ORM will help insure that we meet the needs of the community 
        by providing important tools in the area of object-relational mapping. 
        To aid in this task, Xiao Wang, from Sybase, has joined the project as 
        an architect.&quot;</p>
