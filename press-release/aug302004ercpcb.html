        Project Proposal for Embedded Devices submitted <br>
        by IBM, Motorola and Nokia</b></span></b></h1>
      <P>August 30, 2004 - The Eclipse Foundation announced that IBM, Motorola 
        and Nokia have proposed a new Eclipse Technology project, called the Embedded 
        Rich Client Platform (eRCP). The proposed eRCP project will create several 
        subgroups to investigate the suitability of using various components of 
        the Eclipse RCP in a variety of embedded devices, such as mobile phones 
        and PDAs.</p>
      <P> The Eclipse RCP is the core component of the Eclipse platform that provides 
        1) a generic workbench, 2) user interface components to build rich client 
        user interfaces, 3) a pluggable component model for easy integration of 
        new features and functionality, and 4) an update manager for centralized 
        management of deployed applications. </p>
      <P>The current Eclipse RCP has been primarily focused on desktop computers. 
        The eRCP project will create several subgroups to investigate the refinements 
        required to target the Eclipse RCP for resource constrained embedded devices. 
        Nokia and Motorola will be leading the subgroup investigating the user 
        interface components (eSWT) specifically for use in Java enabled mobile 
        devices. <br>
        <br>
        The eRCP proposal will be available on the Eclipse Foundation website 
        for public review and comment over the next 30 days. To review the proposal 
        and provide feedback please visit the eRCP proposal home page on <a href="../../proposals/eclipse-ercp/index.html" target="_top">www.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-ercp/index.html</a>.
