        Eclipse.org Infrastructure Migration</b></span></b></h1>
      <P>I am very pleased to announce that we are making progress towards migrating 
        the eclipse.org website to a new location managed directly by the Eclipse 
        Foundation. We want to make sure that everyone is aware of the key dates, 
        because there could be impacts on the site's availability as we move. 
        We currently do not have firm projections for downtime. We will provide 
        advance notice of any outages on our home page.<br>
        <br>
        We are planning on moving in two phases. The first move will relocate 
        our download servers. This will also allow us to test the new hosting 
        site and its bandwidth. It also will allow for the least impact on the 
        community, because downloads will continue to be available from our mirrors. 
        In the second phase we will move the remaining servers, including our 
        HTML content, mailing lists, newsgroups, CVS and Bugzilla. <br>
        <br>

        Key Dates:</b><br>
        <br>
        Saturday, October 16, 2004 - move download servers <br>
        Saturday, October 30, 2004 - move all remaining servers </p>

        I am also very happy to announce the the Eclipse Foundation has hired 
        a full-time system administrator. Denis Roy joined us on October 1st. 
        He will be assuming responsibility for webmaster@eclipse.org.<br>
        <br>
        I would like to express a great deal of gratitude to IBM for hosting the 
        eclipse.org site to this point. And in particular, I would like to recognize 
        the efforts of the IBM infrastructure team which has supported the site 
        to date. They have done a truly excellent job.<br>
