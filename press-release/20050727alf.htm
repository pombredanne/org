      <P><b>OTTAWA, ONTARIO, CANADA and SAN MATEO, CA - July 27, 2005</b> - The 
        Eclipse Foundation, an open source community committed to the implementation 
        of a universal development platform, and Serena Software, Inc. (Nasdaq: 
        SRNA), the world's largest company solely focused on managing change in 
        the IT environment, today announced that the Application Lifecycle Framework 
        (ALF) project, an Eclipse technology project and proposed by Serena on 
        April 30 of this year, has been approved by the Eclipse. The ALF project 
        will address the universal problem of integrating Application Lifecycle 
        Management (ALM) technologies so that they provide full inter-operability, 
        including shared ownership of business processes and data transformation 
        from domain to domain. Traditionally tools have integrated to the Eclipse 
        framework as Eclipse plug-ins; this project extends the framework to become 
        the fundamental infrastructure for tool to tool interoperability. </p>
      <P>&quot;The goal of Eclipse is to create a universal development platform 
        to enable global enterprises to develop software more efficiently,&quot; 
        said Mike Milinkovich, Executive Director of the Eclipse Foundation, Inc. 
        &quot;Projects such as this one enable vendors and users alike to provide 
        the vision, innovation and resources to enhance the Eclipse platform. 
        We are looking forward to watching this technology project develop, mature 
        and create even more opportunities for users to further support their 
        ALM development initiatives.&quot;</p>
      <p>The Eclipse Platform provides a universal development platform, component 
        model and extensibility framework for tools integration. The Eclipse Application 
        Lifecycle Framework will extend the Eclipse platform to enable meta-data 
        interoperability and tool choreography that span the entire application 
        development lifecycle. The result will be an Eclipse open source framework 
        that allows ISVs to tightly integrate entire ALM suites or individual 
        ALM products on the widely deployed Eclipse platform, making it easier 
        for developers to manage application changes across the lifecycle, easily 
        and cost-effectively. </p>
      <p>Serena is leading a growing community of technology vendors and ALM users 
        that have collaborated on the definition, planning and implementation 
        of this project and are now beginning its implementation. As the ALF project 
        matures, other entities are encouraged to participate as committers, users 
        and developers to assist in the architecture, planning, requirements and 
        testing of ALF and further increase the value proposition of Eclipse for 
        application developers.</p>
      <p>&quot;Serena is committed to creating solutions that help organizations 
        manage IT change across the application lifecycle,&quot; said Kevin Parker, 
        Vice President of Market Development at Serena. &quot;By leading and driving 
        this effort, Serena is helping to form and shape the outcome of the ALF 
        project and thus the future of the industry, through a framework that 
        allows vendors and customers to maximize productivity from their chosen 
        ALM technologies. We aim to eliminate the shortcomings of point-to-point 
        integrations and provide the interoperability needed to successfully manage 
        customer application lifecycles.&quot;</p>
      <p>Kevin Kernan, CEO of Secure Software commented, &quot;Developers have 
        been long seeking an ALM infrastructure that can assure interoperability 
        among the technologies used to create applications. The ALF project will 
        enable developers to use a broader set of ALM tools that are more integrated 
        and collaborative than ever to improve the quality of the solutions developed. 
        Serena's leading role in the ALF project will help drive additional participation 
        from companies with a unique value proposition to the project, to truly 
        deliver on ALM's promise to its customers.&quot; </p>
      <p>The ALF project is now forming Architecture, Requirements and Planning 
        committees and is seeking vendors and customers to participate. The project 
        timeline is being developed and the initial plan would see a prototype 
        version of the framework being made available for testing by customers 
        and vendors around the end of the calendar year. The first full version 
        will be delivered in 2006 by which time a rich ecosystem of partners and 
        vendors will have formed around the project. For more information on the 
        Eclipse ALF project, please visit: <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/alf/" target="_top">http://www.eclipse.org/alf</a>. 
        Anyone who wishes to express interest in participating in the project 
        should contact the newsgroup at news://news.eclipse.org/eclipse.technology.alf.
