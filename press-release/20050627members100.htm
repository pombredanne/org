      <P><strong>OTTAWA, CANADA &ndash; June 27, 2005</strong> &ndash; The Eclipse Foundation, an open source community 
	  committed to the implementation of a universal development platform, today announced that its 
	  membership has reached the milestone of 100 member organizations. NEC is the 100th organization 
	  to join the Eclipse Foundation and will join as an Add-in Provider member. NEC plans to introduce 
	  new Eclipse-based tools and plug-ins for their C++ and Java development environments. </p>
	  
      <p>Companies like NEC choose to build commercial products in Eclipse&rsquo;s open source-based 
	  ecosystem, because it is an effective and profitable business model. The milestone of 100 members in 
	  the Eclipse Foundation reflects the growth and increasing interest software organizations have in 
	  commercially adopting community-developed Eclipse open source technologies. With each new member the 
	  Eclipse Foundation continues to strengthen its global outreach in the software industry. </p>
	  
      <p>&ldquo;NEC&rsquo;s Systems Integration and Embedded Solutions primarily develop in Java and 
	  C/C++,&rdquo; said Nik Kishinoue, senior manager, software engineering division, NEC Corporation. &ldquo;
	  By using Eclipse and providing a common IDE across these two solutions, we expect to improve our 
	  overall developer productivity. In addition, the broad selection of Eclipse technology, including 
	  testing and performance tools and UML editors brings state-of-the-art technology to our developer 
	  desktop.&rdquo; </p>
	  
      <p>&ldquo;The growth the Eclipse Foundation has seen in 2005 has been tremendous,&rdquo; said Mike 
	  Milinkovich, executive director, Eclipse Foundation. &ldquo;This momentum shows the commercial 
	  viability for open source-based development by ISVs and platform vendors and is a positive indicator 
	  for the future potential of the Eclipse community.&rdquo; </p>
	  
      <p>NEC has also joined the Eclipse Japan Working Group, an organization focused on the issues of the 
	  Japanese and Asia-PAC regions. As part of this Working Group, NEC plans to encourage Japanese Eclipse 
	  community activism within Eclipse and Japanese translation of documents for Eclipse.
