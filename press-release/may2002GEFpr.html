      <P>LONDON--May 15, 2002--The Eclipse Tools project management committee 
        has announced formation of the <u>
		<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/gef-home/main.html?cvsroot=Tools_Project">
		Graphical Editor Framework (GEF) Project</a></u><b>,</b> that will develop a framework 
        for rapidly creating and customizing visual development tools.  Visual 
        tools are a key component of today’s integrated development environments, 
        allowing developers to depict design objects and their interconnected 
        relationships.  These features make it easier to turn concepts into running 
        systems that are easier to support through the deployment life of projects. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The Eclipse community also welcomes Fujitsu, Serena Software and Sybase 
        as they join with Borland, IBM<b>, </b>MERANT, QNX Software Systems, Rational 
        Software, Red Hat, SuSE, TogetherSoft and WebGain as supporting members.  
        Representatives of these companies, each of which plans to release Eclipse 
        Platform compatible product offerings, expand the Eclipse Board of Stewards 
        to 12 members. </P>
      <P>Eclipse is the open source environment for creating, integrating 
        and deploying application development tools for use across a broad range 
        of computing technologies .  With today’s announcement, the leadership 
        of the Eclipse community expands to include industry leaders that create 
        tools, middleware, database, web services, and content management technology 
        for use across all computing deployment environments from wristwatches 
        through mainframes.</P>
<p>“The 
  committed involvement of this broad range of member companies creates a unique 
  opportunity for projects like GEF that blends the best of open source community 
  principles and robust technology,” said Skip McGaughey, chairperson of the Eclipse 
  Board of Stewards.  “This establishes an opportunity for research into improving 
  the software development process and ensuring that tools users have a genuine 
  choice in products and offerings.”</p>
<p>With 
  it’s widely accepted “Common Public License” that is certified by the Open Software 
  Foundation, Eclipse is proving a popular choice for development of new tools 
  and the integration of best of breed technology. Eclipse establishes a level 
  playing field for integrating work from the community of open source developers 
  and a variety of vendors.  The “CPL” allows creation of derivative works from 
  Eclipse with worldwide re-distribution rights that are royalty free.</p>
<p>Eclipse 
  manages two open source projects: the Eclipse Project that addresses core platform 
  development and the Eclipse Tools Project that focuses on tools built to run 
  on the Eclipse Platform.  Earlier this year, the “C/C++ IDE” sub-project launched 
  with a set of plug-in tools for C and C++ language based development targeting 
  Linux®.  With today’s announcement, the Eclipse “Graphical Editor Framework” 
  sub-project has been proposed, supporting the creation of visual graphics based 
  plug-ins.  Interested developers and tools providers can participate by contacting 
  Eclipse at <a
href="mailto:tools-dev@eclipse.org">tools-dev@eclipse.org</a>. </p>
<p>Work on the Eclipse 
  Project is now rapidly moving toward release of the version 2.0 Eclipse Platform.  
  Full details of the Eclipse.org community and the design of the Eclipse Platform 
  are available at <a
