      <p align="center" class="style3 style4">Contributes J2ME Tooling to Open Source Community</p>
      <P><strong>ESPOO, Finland, and OTTAWA, Canada &ndash; September 19, 2005 </strong>&ndash; Nokia (NYSE: NOK) and the Eclipse Foundation today 
	  announced that Nokia has joined the Eclipse Foundation as a Strategic Developer and Board member. Nokia 
	  will support the work of the Eclipse open source community by contributing software and developers to a 
	  proposed new Eclipse project.</p>
      <p>As a Strategic Developer in the Eclipse Foundation, Nokia will lead a project to create a framework for 
	  mobile Java developer tools, including complete tooling support for J2ME (Java 2 Micro Edition). The 
	  project will deliver a sustainable mobile tools offering for all developers and companies who wish to 
	  create mobile Java applications and build commercial tools for Java. Nokia plans to donate several 
	  components of its existing Java development tools technology as well as actively develop new software 
	  to introduce tools for the creation of both MIDP (Mobile Information Device Profile) and CDC (Connected 
	  Device Configuration) based mobile Java applications. Furthermore, Nokia plans to use the Eclipse tools 
	  platform widely in its tools portfolio and will actively contribute to several existing Eclipse projects 
	  beyond the scope of Java.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;By working closely with Eclipse, and proposing a new open source mobile development tools 
	  project, we will provide the more than two million registered developers in our Forum Nokia program with 
	  complete integrated tool packages optimized for Nokia platforms,&rdquo; said Pertti Korhonen, executive 
	  vice president and chief technology officer, Nokia. &ldquo;In addition, developers creating mobile 
	  applications will be able to work more efficiently and achieve greater productivity by using the same 
	  Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for multiple programming languages and software platforms.&quot;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Nokia&rsquo;s membership in Eclipse reinforces our commitment to open source initiatives,&rdquo; 
	  Mr. Korhonen added. &ldquo;This important step enables us to simplify our creation of tools and further 
	  harmonize our development tools offering across all Nokia software platforms. We expect to benefit from 
	  open source innovation and to create interest and active participation in Nokia-led mobile tools projects 
	  for the benefit of all members of the Eclipse community.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Nokia&rsquo;s Eclipse initiatives date from 2004 when it announced support for the Eclipse platform in 
	  the Nokia Developer&rsquo;s Suite for J2ME and the Nokia Mobile Server Services SDK. Also starting in 2004, 
	  Nokia contributed key development resources and leadership to the Embedded Rich Client Platform (eRCP) 
	  project at Eclipse. Nokia also has provided the ability for Java developers to integrate any Nokia platform 
	  SDK supporting MIDP into the Eclipse environment and will make additional Eclipse tools announcements in 
	  4Q 2005 as part of its plan to host the majority of its tools offerings in Eclipse. </p>
      <p>&ldquo;Mobile computing is an important part of Eclipse's future and supports our goal of delivering a 
	  universal tools platform,&rdquo; said Mike Milinkovich, executive director, Eclipse Foundation. &ldquo;We 
	  are pleased to have an industry leader like Nokia on board as a Strategic Developer and actively leading 
	  key new projects focused on J2ME and mobility.&rdquo;</p>
