        Eclipse Foundation Launches New Web Infrastructure to Support the Expanding Eclipse Community</b></span></b></h1>
      <ul>
        <li>HP, IBM, Intel and Novell Contribute Technology Resources for Critical Upgrade</li>
      </ul>      
      <P>Ottawa, ON&mdash;June 1, 2005 -- The Eclipse Foundation today announced 
        a major infrastructure upgrade of the Eclipse community web site (<a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="_top">http://www.eclipse.org</a>). 
        This upgrade was made possible through contributions of hardware and software 
        from HP, IBM, Intel and Novell. Due to increased Web traffic and download 
        rates among the burgeoning Eclipse open source community, Eclipse.org&rsquo;s 
        web infrastructure has been redesigned to scale for growth and ensure 
        high availability for the entire community. </p>
	  
      <p>With approximately 1.2 million page views on an average day and 10 terabytes of data transferred per 
	  month, the previous infrastructure for the site was under a constant strain. As more companies join the 
	  Eclipse Foundation and Eclipse technologies gain adoption across the industry, it was clear that a major
	   change to the infrastructure was necessary. A new product release of Eclipse-based open source 
	   projects, such as the upcoming Eclipse 3.1 Platform launch, could cause massive surges in traffic and 
	   bring downloads to a standstill. With the new architecture, throughput is greatly increased as are the 
	   expanded capabilities needed for periods of high traffic. </p>
	   
      <p>&ldquo;As the membership of the Foundation and the usage of the technology continues to grow, the 
	  scale and complexity of our site has expanded dramatically,&rdquo; said Mike Milinkovich, executive 
	  director of the Eclipse Foundation. &ldquo;We thank HP, IBM, Intel and Novell &ndash; all active 
	  members and leaders in open source &ndash; for their generous contributions toward better serving the 
	  needs of the community. With their help, we can continue our commitment to support the broad array of 
	  open source development in the Eclipse ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>HP, IBM, Intel and Novell contributed software, hardware and expertise to help the Eclipse Foundation build this new web infrastructure. </p>
      <p>HP contributed four new HP Integrity rx2600 servers, each equipped with two Intel&reg; Itanium&reg; 2 processors and 8GB of memory.</p>
      <p>Intel contributed eight 1.3GHz Intel® Itanium® 2 processors that were coupled with the servers 
	  contributed by HP. In addition to the processors, Intel IT also contributed their expertise in 
	  large-scale enterprise computing by providing valuable assistance with the architectural design 
	  and implementation of the scalable and highly-available new Eclipse computing infrastructure.</p>
      <p>IBM provided to the Foundation three IBM eServer p5 550 servers, each powered by four POWER5 
	  processors and 16G of memory. The company also provided resources to help Eclipse expand its 
	  memory and storage space. IBM contributed 24 36G disks and an IBM TotalStorage EXP Plus 320 with 
	  14 146G disks.</p>
      <p>Novell donated SUSE LINUX Enterprise Server 9 for Intel Itanium Processor Family and IBM 
	  POWER processors for the infrastructure, as well as technical support services. </p></td>
