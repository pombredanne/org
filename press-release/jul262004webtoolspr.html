        Eclipse Launches Web Tools Platform Project</b></span></b></h1>
      <P>OTTAWA, ONTARIO, CANADA and GRENOBLE, FRANCE - July 26, 2004 - The Eclipse 
        Foundation, a community committed to the implementation of a universal 
        platform for tools integration, and ObjectWeb, the international not-for-profit 
        consortium dedicated to open-source infrastructure software and provider 
        of JOnAS, the leading non-commercial, open-source J2EE application server, 
        today announced the launch of the Eclipse Web Tools Platform (WTP) project 
        on eclipse.org. </p>
      <P> ObjectWeb played the lead role in facilitating the project proposal, 
        with active involvement and support from Eclipse organizations and other 
        participants in the project. Formal project approval occurred on June 
        25 following a 30-day period for open review by the community.</p>
      <P>Christophe Ney, ObjectWeb's executive director, commented, &quot;ObjectWeb 
        has enjoyed working with Eclipse and the community to launch this project 
        and looks forward to participating in project leadership going forward. 
        ObjectWeb's mission is to contribute to an open-source ecosystem supporting 
        enterprise software that will drive lasting economic benefits for the 
        vendor, developer and end-user communities. We see Eclipse as a key factor 
        in that ecosystem and are excited to be contributing to its future growth.&quot;</p>
      <P> &quot;The Web Tools Platform project is an exciting new expansion of 
        both the Eclipse technology portfolio and our community of developers,&quot; 
        said Mike Milinkovich, executive director of Eclipse. &quot;ObjectWeb's 
        support was instrumental in establishing the project and we look forward 
        to continuing to work with them in the future.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <P>Bjorn Freeman-Benson of the University of Washington has been selected 
        by the Eclipse Foundation to lead this project. &quot;We expect the WTP 
        project to quickly become the platform of choice underlying vendor-specific 
        J2EE tooling. The ObjectWeb Consortium provided the much needed drive 
        to put the project together,&quot; said Freeman-Benson. &quot;I see their 
        efforts in setting up the WTP proposal as the first step in a durable, 
        synergistic relationship based on common values and complementary positioning 
        between our two communities.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <P>Organizations that have already committed resources to the Eclipse Web 
        Tools Platform project include Bull, Eteration, Exadel, Frameworx, Genuitec, 
        IBM, Innoopract, INRIA, Librados, OpenWide, Thales IS, Together Teaml&ouml;sungen 
        and XQuark Group.</p>

            <P> The Eclipse Foundation is a not-for-profit member-supported corporation 
              that hosts community based open projects. Eclipse creates royalty-free 
              technology and a universal platform for development tools integration, 
              modeling, testing and functionally-rich application construction. 
              Eclipse-based offerings give developers freedom of choice in a multi-language, 
              multi-platform, multi-vendor supported environment. Eclipse delivers 
              a dynamic plug-in based framework that makes it easier to create 
              and integrate technology, saving time and money. By collaborating 
              and sharing core integration technology, providers can concentrate 
              and focus on areas of expertise and differentiation. The Eclipse 
              Platform is written in the Java language and comes with extensive 
              plug-in construction toolkits and examples. It has already been 
              deployed on a range of development workstations including Linux, 
              QNX, Mac OS X and Windows-based systems. Full details of the Eclipse 
              Foundation and white papers documenting the design of the Eclipse 
              Platform are available at www.eclipse.org.<br>

              a consortium of leading companies and research organizations from 
              around the world that have joined forces to produce the next generation 
              of open-source middleware. ObjectWeb's goal is to provide real-time 
              enterprises with independent solutions which combine quality and 
              robustness at the best possible performance/cost ratio. ObjectWeb 
              targets alternative solutions to proprietary products for e-business, 
              EAI, data connectivity, grid computing and enterprise messaging. 
              Based on open standards, ObjectWeb's middleware includes application 
              servers, components, frameworks and tools. Examples of ObjectWeb's 
              &quot;cost killer&quot; middleware are JOnAS, an Open-Source implementation 
              of the J2EE specification; JORAM, message oriented middleware; Lomboz, 
              a J2EE plug-in for Eclipse; and Enhydra, a Java/XML application
