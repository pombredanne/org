      <P>December 16, 2002 - Today, the Eclipse Consortium announced that it has 
        welcomed thirteen new supporting member companies and organizations and 
        that it is launching four new open-source projects for tools and technology 
        implementation: COBOL, Project Hyades for Automated Software Quality, 
        the Eclipse Modeling Framework and the Koi Project. This adds to the momentum 
        that Eclipse has seen with over 3.1 million download requests logged from 
        over 125 countries in its first year. A worldwide "eco-system" of tools 
        providers and consumers is forming around the Eclipse Platform, an open 
        universal tools integration platform for multi-language, multi-platform 
        and multi-vendor choice. Eclipse makes it easier for technology producers 
        and consumers to create, integrate and use integrated software tools, 
        saving developers time and money. </p>
      <p>Eclipse is now supported by providers of a broad range of development 
        technologies including specialists in modeling, code generation, metadata 
        management, testing, embedded computing, enterprise middleware, collaboration, 
        services, research and application systems vendors. The thirteen new member 
        companies and organization that have joined the Eclipse Consortium since 
        September include: AltoWeb, Catalyst Systems, Flashline, Hewlett Packard, 
        ETRI (the Korean information technology research institute), MKS Software, 
        Oracle, Parasoft, SAP, SlickEdit, Teamstudio, Timesys and OMG, the Object 
        Management Group. They join members: Fujitsu, Hitachi, Ltd., Instantiations, 
        Inc., MontaVista Software, Scapa Technologies Limited, Serena Software, 
        Sybase, Telelogic, Trans-Enterprise Integration Corp. and founding members 
        Borland, IBM, MERANT, QNX Software Systems, Rational Software, RedHat, 
        SuSE, and TogetherSoft in providing ongoing support for Eclipse open-source 
        projects.</p>
      <p>Eclipse is structured in open-source projects supported by member companies 
        and individuals that freely contribute support, technology and skill. 
        The four new open-source projects are forming to extend the core Eclipse 
        Platform with tools, frameworks and reusable technology for key development 
        areas. These projects include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tools for developing in the COBOL Language, based upon a donation 
          from Fujitsu</li>
		  <li>The Eclipse Modeling Framework - a model driven metadata 
          management framework based upon OMG's Model Driven Architecture, with 
          participation from IBM, Rational, and Togethersoft</li>
		  <li>Project Hyades, 
          a new framework and reusable technology supporting deployment of Automated 
          Software Quality (test and trace) tools led by IBM, Scapa Technologies, 
          Telelogic and Parasoft</li>
		  <li>Koi Project - a new infrastructure supporting 
          collaborative development activities between team members led by Instantiations, 
          Inc. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>A growing number of offerings "Powered by Eclipse Technology" are now
available from member companies like Catalyst (OpenMake), Flashline (CMEE),
IBM (WebSphere Studio), Instantiations (CodePro Studio), MERANT (PVCS),
ParaSoft (Jtest), QNX Software Systems (Momentics), RATIONAL (XDE;
ClearCase), Teamstudio (Analyzer for Java), Telelogic (Synergy) and others.
Embarcadero, Genuitec, Interwoven, Junit, MacroMedia, MKS, Parasoft,
Sitraka, StarBase, Versant, and Versata have introduced commercially
available Eclipse based offerings. </p>

		  <td> Eclipse is an open source eco-system of royalty-free technology and a
universal platform for tools integration. Eclipse based tools give
developers freedom of choice in a multi-language, multi-platform,
multi-vendor supported environment. Eclipse delivers a plug-in based
framework that makes it easier to create, integrate and use software tools,
saving time and money. By collaborating and sharing core integration
technology, tool producers can concentrate on their areas of expertise and
the creation of new development technology.  The Eclipse Platform is
written
in the Java(tm) language, and comes with extensive plug-in construction
toolkits and examples.  It has already been deployed on a range of
development workstations including Linux®, QNX® and Windows® based systems.
