      <P><b>SYNOPSIS: </b>Top-level Eclipse Project addresses the common need 
        for data tooling infrastructure and the desire to extend the offerings 
        in new and innovative ways<br>
      </p>
      <p><b>OTTAWA and DUBLIN, Calif. - August 29, 2005</b> - The Eclipse Foundation, 
        an open source community committed to the development of a universal development 
        platform, and Sybase, Inc. (NYSE: SY), a leading provider of enterprise 
        infrastructure and mobile software, today announced approval of the new 
        Data Tools Platform (DTP) project proposal. Submitted by Sybase in February, 
        the DTP project will provide a comprehensive set of data management frameworks 
        and a representative suite of data management tools, which are essential 
        for data centric application development.</p>
      <p> &quot;The DTP Project will be an enabling technology - the platform 
        upon which more extensive data management products will be built,&quot; 
        said Mike Milinkovich, executive director of the Eclipse Foundation. &quot;Sybase 
        is a recognized leader in data management and data tooling, and the Eclipse 
        community will benefit greatly from its leadership on the new Data Tools 
        Platform Project.&quot;</p>
      <p>The DTP Project recognizes both the common need for data tooling infrastructure 
        and the desire to extend the offerings in new and innovative ways. Initially 
        the DTP Project will contain the following three projects, and emphasize 
        relational data sources and structures:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Model Base - Provides the foundation for DTP, using industry best 
          practices such as model-driven development with UML, and taking advantage 
          of the Eclipse Modeling Framework. Initially included are models for 
          driver definition, database definition, SQL and SQL Query </li>
        <li>Connectivity - Includes components for defining, connecting to, and 
          working with data sources, which include: Driver Management Framework, 
          Connection Management Framework, JDBC connection support, Data Source 
          Explorer, and Open Data Access.</li>
        <li>SQL Development Tools -Provides frameworks and tools for deep and 
          broad SQL support, including: Routines Editor Framework, Routines Debugger 
          Framework, SQL Query Parser, SQL Execution Plan Framework, SQL Editor, 
          Visual SQL Builder, Results View, and Script History.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> &quot;Sybase has been involved with Eclipse since early 2002 and is 
        fully committed to it as a framework,&quot; said David Tong, vice president 
        of engineering, Sybase. &quot;We are excited about the Data Tools Platform 
        Project and how it will allow developers to stay ahead of the curve by 
        enabling real-world development across a host of mixed software and hardware 
        environments.&quot; </p>
      <p>Additional members of the Project Management Committee on the DTP project 
        include IBM and Actuate. For more information on the Eclipse DTP project, 
        please visit: <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/datatools/" target="_top">http://www.eclipse.org/datatools</a>.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;IBM has been actively contributing database tools for the Eclipse 
        Web Tools Platform (WTP) Project over the past year, and will be providing 
        significant capabilities within the DTP Project,&quot; said Bernie Spang, 
        Director IBM Database Servers. &quot;We see this as an opportunity to 
        establish a common set of tools to accelerate the adoption of Eclipse 
        for building dynamic applications and reduce development costs for our 
        customers.&quot; </p>
      <p>&quot;Actuate is pleased to be participating in the Data Tools Platform 
        project, both in terms of assisting in the management of it and by donating 
        code to provide the basis of the Open Data Access (ODA) capability in 
        the Connectivity project,&quot; said Mark Coggins, senior vice president 
        of engineering at Actuate Corporation. &quot;We look forward to leveraging 
        a number of DTP capabilities in the Business Intelligence and Reporting 
        Tools (BIRT) project, particularly SQL modeling and editing.&quot; <br>
