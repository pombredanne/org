      <P>ASHEVILLE, NC-March 3, 2004-Four new members of the Eclipse Board of
Directors, representing the organization's Open Source project community and
commercial supporters, were announced today. Newly elected, Todd Williams
(Genuitec, LLC), John Wiegand (Eclipse Project Lead, IBM); Rich Main (SAS),
and Bjorn Freeman-Benson (University of Washington) join the board, which
already includes Ronald Ingman (Ericsson), Michael J. Rank (Hewlett
Packard), Dave Thomson (IBM), Jonathan Khazam (Intel), Jim Ready (MontaVista
Software), Dan Dodge (QNX Software Systems Ltd.), Michael Bechauf (SAP AG)
and Boris Kapitanski (Serena Software). This establishes the founding
twelve-member Eclipse Board of Directors, responsible for approving Eclipse
strategy, development roadmaps and release plans, and establishing
organization policy.</p>
      <P>"Genuitec is very pleased to be able to continue our strategic involvement
with the Eclipse Foundation," said Todd Williams, vice president of
technology for Genuitec.  Through our membership in the Board of Directors,
we will work to expand the Eclipse ecosystem in its current market segments
(integrated development environment users, add-in providers and rich client
platform adopters) while fostering its adoption in additional market
segments."</p>
      <P>Bjorn Freeman-Benson said, "I'm honored to have been elected by the
committers as one of their two representatives on the Board. I look forward
to working with the rest of the Board to expand the Eclipse community by
encouraging low-overhead ways for people to contribute."</p>
      <P>"The rapid and broad adoption of Eclipse technology is proof to a very
strong market demand for open standards and common platforms worldwide,"
said Jim Ready, chief executive officer and president, MontaVista Software.
"I am honored to serve on the Eclipse Board of Directors. MontaVista
Software has proudly demonstrated our commitment to Eclipse, by adopting it
as a strategic development framework, through its founding membership in
Eclipse, and with ongoing contributions to Eclipse technology. We continue
to look forward to being part of this important initiative."</p>
      <P>"I look forward to serving on the Eclipse Foundation Board of Directors,"
said Rich Main, director of Java development environments at SAS.  "SAS is
committed to working with the Eclipse community to strengthen the growth and
adoption of Eclipse.  This will be a critical year for the Eclipse
Foundation as we strive to move from an organization that is focused
primarily on the development community to one that is an increasingly
attractive option for end-user consumers, as well.  We intend to work in
partnership with the entire Eclipse community to make this transition as
smooth and successful as possible."</p>
      <P>Originally a consortium that formed when IBM released the Eclipse Platform
into Open Source, Eclipse has now been incorporated as an independent,
not-for-profit organization. Tangible support from 58 member companies
enables Eclipse to host and nurture 19 Open Source projects that originated
in commercial and academic contexts. In just 2 years, this community has
professionally delivered the most broadly deployed and fastest growing
universal tools integration platform in history. All technology and source
code provided within this fast-growing ecosystem remains openly available
and royalty-free.</p>
      <P>Worldwide, Eclipse membership represents individual contributors and large
and small companies with interests ranging from embedded computing and Linux
through traditional enterprise class information technology. </p>
      <P>"With constitution of our founding Board of Directors, Eclipse is now
traveling on the industry-neutral path that is critical for integration
technology," said Skip McGaughey, spokesperson for Eclipse. "This launches
the most significant step forward in the evolution of Eclipse as an
organization. For the Open Source development community we're establishing a
support base that will strengthen the projects and expand a powerful
reusable architecture. For commercial and academic users of Eclipse
technology, this means a more open management process and improved choices
in a stable and reliable environment."</p>

            <P> A vibrant open eco-system has formed around royalty-free Eclipse 
              technology, a universal platform for tools integration. Eclipse 
              based tools give developers freedom of choice in a multi-language, 
              multi-platform, multi-vendor environment. Eclipse provides an award 
              winning plug-in based framework that makes it easier to create, 
              integrate and utilize software tools, saving time and money. By 
              collaborating and exploiting core integration technology, tool producers 
              can leverage platform reuse and concentrate on core competencies 
              to create new development technology. The Eclipse Platform is written 
              in the Java language and comes with extensive plug-in construction 
              toolkits and examples. It has already been deployed on a range of 
              development workstations including Linux, QNX, Mac OS X and Windows-based 
              systems. Release distribution downloads, a full description of the 
              Eclipse community and white papers documenting the design and use 
              of the Eclipse Platform are available at <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="_blank">http://www.eclipse.org</a>.</p>
