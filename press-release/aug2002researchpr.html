      <P><b>Ottawa, Ontario, August 20, 2002</b>--The Eclipse community has established 
        the Eclipse Technology Project, an open-source project that supports research, 
        education and engineering initiatives designed to integrate a wide variety 
        of leading edge computing technologies with the Eclipse Platform.  IBM’s 
        Eclipse Fellowship Program, which funds university based research in the 
        areas of programming languages, tools, and environments, complements this 
        effort.  All Eclipse Fellowship projects use the Eclipse Platform as a 
        foundation to conduct their research. 
      <p>The Eclipse community’s royalty-free technology establishes a universal 
        platform for tools integration.  Eclipse based tools give developers freedom 
        of choice in a multi-language, multi-platform, multi-vendor supported 
        environment.  Eclipse delivers a plug-in based framework that makes it 
        easier to create, integrate and use software tools, saving time and money.  
        This solid base helps projects explore new technologies more efficiently 
        since it is no longer necessary to implement tools from scratch. </p>
      <p>The open-source Eclipse platform provides an advanced object-oriented 
        framework  allowing  “plug-in” functions and extending facilities. This 
        frees researchers to concentrate on areas of study and specialization. 
        The open-source community will benefit from these efforts as new approaches 
        to software engineering and project development are proven in the Eclipse 
        tools environment.</p>
      <p>Funding provided by IBM will be used by research projects to purchase 
        equipment and staff projects.  Open-source assets donated by IBM and other 
        Eclipse community members allow research to take place on a broad range 
        of embedded, personal computer, workstation and server platforms.  The 
        Eclipse Platform and any assets donated by research projects back to Eclipse 
        are provided under terms of the “Common Public License”, certified as 
        open-source by the Open Software Foundation (<a href="http://www.osf.org/">http://www.osf.org</a>). 
      </p>
      <p><b>Active Technology Project activities include:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Aspect Oriented Software Development – a new technology permitting 
          separation of concerns in software development.  The techniques of AOSD 
          make it possible to modularize cross-cutting aspects of a system. </li>
        <li>Stellation - a software configuration management system for building 
          systems based on the integration of fine-grained software artifacts 
          through advanced or experimental source code management techniques with 
          the Eclipse development environment. </li>
        <li>XML Schema Infoset Model - work establishing a common API and Java 
          library to be used in tools and development processes that model information, 
          messages or interfaces using the W3C XML Schema Language. </li></ul>

	  <p>“Eclipse is expanding its focus to include forward looking research into 
        areas important to software developers,” said Skip McGaughey, chairperson 
        of the Eclipse Board of Stewards. “As a universal tools platform, Eclipse 
        technology provides researchers with a rich and sophisticated open source 
        infrastructure for conducting their investigations, allowing them to focus 
        more of their time and effort on developing new technology.” </p>
      <p>From Professor Dwight Deugo, associate professor, Carleton University, 
        School  of Computer Science, Ottawa, Canada, “It is common for developers 
        to think of a software development tool as an environment that enables 
        them to write code, such as Java class files, and share it through a shared 
        repository. While this is possible with the open-source Eclipse platform, 
        the plug-in based framework will enable developers to expand on the notion 
        of development tools. Eclipse is the platform for any and every software 
        tool.”</p>

Eclipse is an open-source community that creates technology 
  and a universal platform for tools integration. The open-source Eclipse 
  community creates royalty-free technology as a platform for tools integration. 
  Eclipse based tools give developers freedom of choice in a multi-language, multi-platform, 
  multi-vendor supported environment. Eclipse delivers a plug-in based framework 
  that makes it easier to create, integrate and use software tools, saving time 
  and money. By collaborating and sharing core integration technology, tool producers 
  can concentrate on their areas of expertise and the creation of new development 
  technology.  The Eclipse Platform is written in the Java™ language, and comes 
  with extensive plug-in construction toolkits and examples.  It has already been 
  deployed on a range of development workstations including Linux®, QNX® and Windows® 
  based systems.  Full details of the Eclipse community and white papers documenting 
  the design of the Eclipse Platform are available at <a
