        <LI>New Development Platforms Include AIX, Solaris, HP-UX</LI>

      <P><b>Ottawa, Ontario, September 18, 2002</b>--The new version
of the Eclipse platform has broadened its support for international
languages and development platforms while adding enhancements that make
development tools more usable, run faster, and integrate more seamlessly, it
was announced today by Eclipse.org. The royalty-free open-source
distribution of the Eclipse Platform R2.0 is available immediately via
download from www.eclipse.org</p>
<p>
Eclipse has expanded its reach worldwide with new translated versions in
nine languages including French, German, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese,
Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Taiwanese. In addition,
Eclipse R2 will make it easier to integrate tools that use character-based
languages such as traditional Chinese, and right-to-left languages such as
Hebrew and Arabic. This broadened language support, including the nine
translations donated by IBM to the open source community, allows integration
of tools that observe specific national language preferences for keyboard
layouts, user interfaces, help-text messages, formatting and sorting
characters and symbols.</p>
<p>
Eclipse R2 will expand its support for development platforms to include
workstations running QNX® on Intel X86® based computers, Sun Solaris® on
SPARC® workstations, HP-UX® on HP9000® PA-RISC workstations, and IBM AIX® on
PowerPC® workstations. This extends existing support for Windows® and Linux®
on Intel X86® based computers.</p>
<p>
In addition, Eclipse is now more accessible to the visually or physically
impaired through new accessibility features that make it possible to use the
platform with keyboard strokes, rather than with a mouse or other pointing
device. This also better meets the needs of developers, who use the keyboard
for programming tasks. These accessibility features meet US Government
Section 508 guidelines, so companies using Eclipse-based tools can now bid
on government contracts. </p>
<p>
Eclipse R2 also makes developers more productive with support for Java
Development Kit (JDK) 1.4, including a new "quick fix" for automatically
finding and fixing errors, and greater support for providers of team
development tools. The new version of Eclipse also delivers a better
end-user experience through faster platform startup time, better
integration, features that make the platform easier to service and maintain,
and easier plug-in installation.</p>
<p>
The Eclipse community creates technology for an open, portal-like industry
platform for tools integration. Built on $40 million of technology donated
by IBM in 2001 to the open source community, Eclipse-based tools give
projects freedom of choice in a environment with multiple languages,
platforms, devices and vendors. Eclipse delivers a plug-in based framework
that makes it easier to create, integrate and use software tools, saving
customers and tool providers time and money. Over 35 new offerings powered
by Eclipse technology have been introduced in recent months, while more than
two million users have downloaded the Eclipse platform and more than 175
tool vendors are delivering tools for the Eclipse platform.</p>
<p>
Eclipse.org also announced that the Open Source Initiative
(www.opensource.org) has certified that the Common Public License Version
1.0 conforms to their open source definition. The royalty-free Eclipse R2.0
distribution is made available through this license, and has been designated
as OSI Certified Open Source Software. </p>
<p>
"As far as R2.0 goes, I'm hard-pressed to pick out a single favorite
feature," said Todd Williams, vice president of technology at Genuitec
(www.genuitec.com), a leading services and custom tools provider. "My
interaction with the Java IDE that comes with Eclipse was so smooth,
seamless, and natural that the "tool wasn't the focus; my work was. There is
no other IDE that I can say that about. Eclipse 2.0 comes with simply the
best tools technology I've ever used."</p>
<p>
Ming Zhou, Senior Software Engineer with eCustomers, Inc. in Austin, Texas,
says, "I have tried almost every other major free and commercial IDE out
there. I'm using Eclipse now and am absolutely in love with it. The
uniformity and consistency demonstrated by a number of its plug-ins make me
confident that it's an excellent framework to work with. Every reference to
Eclipse that I have seen so far is very positive."</p>
<p>
"Eclipse brings tool and project developers a new degree of control and
choice in open tools integration," said Skip McGaughey, chairperson of the
Eclipse Board of Stewards. "The Eclipse Platform R2.0 represents significant
technical enhancement delivered through the powerful collaboration of
open-source volunteers supported by committed commercial tools providers."</p>

Eclipse is an open-source community that creates technology and a universal
platform for tools integration. The open-source Eclipse community creates
royalty-free technology as a platform for tools integration. Eclipse based
tools give developers freedom of choice in a multi-language, multi-platform,
multi-vendor supported environment. Eclipse delivers a plug-in based
framework that makes it easier to create, integrate and use software tools,
saving time and money. By collaborating and sharing core integration
technology, tool producers can concentrate on their areas of expertise and
the creation of new development technology. The Eclipse Platform is written
in the Java? language, and comes with extensive plug-in construction
toolkits and examples. It has already been deployed on a range of
development workstations including Linux®, QNX® and Windows® based systems.
