        <li>New Strategic Developers and Eclipse Project Releases Mark Successful Sold-Out Event</li>
      </ul>
      <P>ECLIPSECON 2005, BURLINGAME, CA&mdash;March 1, 2005&mdash;The Eclipse Foundation today announced the start of the second annual EclipseCon conference, which takes place at the Hyatt Regency in Burlingame, Calif. and will run through March 3, 2005. Highlights from the sold-out show include the addition of several new Strategic Developers and the availability of several Eclipse projects&rsquo; milestone releases. The sold-out event will have 1000 attendees, dozens of sessions and tutorials and 37 exhibitors. This year&rsquo;s conference attests to the enormous traction the Eclipse community has gained in the industry and the popularity of the Eclipse platform among developers and corporate IT groups. </p>
      <p>&ldquo;Since its founding, Eclipse has made great strides towards a single vision of an open development platform and a vibrant ecosystem. The strong response from developers and the support of our members have helped make EclipseCon an overwhelming success,&rdquo; said Mike Milinkovich, executive director of the Eclipse Foundation. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve reached a critical mass at the Strategic Developer level and are well on our way to establishing Eclipse as the universal development platform. As we move forward, Eclipse will be focused on replicating our successes to date into other key areas of the software development lifecycle.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>EclipseCon 2005 is the pre-eminent gathering of Eclipse developers, members and organizations using and deploying Eclipse-based technologies. The show also provides a forum to discuss key issues facing the community and to hear about developments to come in 2005. Show highlights include:</p>
