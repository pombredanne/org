      <h1 ALIGN="CENTER"> Eclipse Test &amp; Performance Tools Platform Project Announces Availability of Release 3.2 </h1>
      <p>&nbsp; </p>
      <p><strong> OTTAWA</strong><strong> , ONTARIO, CANADA</strong> &ndash;<strong>December 
        21, 2004</strong>&ndash;The Eclipse Test &amp; Performance Tools Platform 
        (TPTP) Project, a top-level project in the Eclipse Foundation, announced 
        that the TPTP release 3.2 will be available on the Eclipse Foundation 
        website (<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" target="_top">www.eclipse.org</a>) 
        this week. TPTP 3.2 is the second significant platform release since the 
        August 2004 creation of the TPTP Project, an evolution of the previous 
        Eclipse &lsquo;Hyades&rsquo; Project. </p>
      <p>The Eclipse TPTP Project provides an open, standards-based platform supplying powerful frameworks and services for the development of software test and performance tools that are used throughout the application lifecycle from early testing to production application monitoring . TPTP 3.2 provides significant enhancements to the platform&rsquo;s user interface, data-collection and Java tracing system. The platform&rsquo;s own testing facilities helped with the testing of these enhancements. </p>
      <p><strong>TPTP 3.2 Highlights </strong></p>
      <p> Key enhancements in TPTP 3.2 include the following: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Enhanced data collection and communication with additional control over the selection of data-collection agents and information within the user interface </li>
        <li> Improved statistical analysis representation and viewing </li>
        <li> Better Java tracing capability </li>
        <li> Additional documentation and help facilities with improved user help architecture and supporting documents </li>
        <li> Simplified test deployment with supplementary automation for the creation and running of tests</li>
        <li>Improved execution history that collects and makes available added data within the test execution history framework </li>
      </ul>      
      <p> &ldquo;TPTP has made remarkable progress toward becoming a viable platform 
        choice for Intel performance analysis tools in environments where options 
        are limited such as Linux.&rdquo; said Tyler Thessin, engineering manager 
        for Intel Software Development Products and project lead for the TPTP 
        Project. &ldquo;Intel is looking forward to further unleashing the power 
        of the TPTP platform and contributing our extensive experience in software 
        performance analysis tools to the industry .&rdquo; <br>

TPTP 3.2 continues to enhance the platform&rsquo;s effectiveness and usability,&rdquo; commented Michael Norman, chief executive officer of Scapa Technologies and project lead for the TPTP Testing Tools Project. &ldquo;The continued growth and development of TPTP benefits vendors such as ourselves and encourages us to add value in innovative and groundbreaking ways through our own product offerings.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Serge Lucio, senior product manager at IBM Software Group and project lead for the TPTP Tracing and Profiling Tools Project, said, &quot;Over the last two years, TPTP has evolved into a robust platform for the construction of interoperable test and performance tools. TPTP offers a tremendous opportunity across industries to better integrate software quality tools, enabling a continuous verification of quality throughout the application development and deployment lifecycle. Concurrent with this release, IBM Rational has delivered a brand new set of products that extend TPTP, illustrating our commitment to adopt TPTP across our product line.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;TPTP 3.2 demonstrates that TPTP is evolving in a sustainable manner and has achieved the maturity needed for test and performance tool vendors like OC Systems to commit to this platform,&quot; said Oliver Cole, president of OC Systems. &quot;We are excited about enhancing TPTP with our own products, as well as taking advantage of the platform to improve the interoperability and functionality of our toolset.&quot;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;This latest release of TPTP again demonstrates the power 
              of the open-source development model,&rdquo; said Robert Levy, senior 
              vice president of development at CA. &ldquo;CA will continue to 
              leverage TPTP to help our customers maximize the technical performance 
              and business value of their enterprise Java-based systems.&rdquo;</p>
