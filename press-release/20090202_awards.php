			Eclipse and its role in contributing to a flexible, heterogeneous SOA, both
			through development of WSO2 products that support Eclipse and continuing
			education of the developer community via conferences, webinars, blogs and the
			WSO2 forum. However, his most important initiative has been around the use of
			Eclipse Equinox to fundamentally redefine the structure of SOA
			middlewareâ€”extending beyond the componentization of individual products to
			create a fully componentized SOA middleware platform. 
			<br><br>
			With WSO2 Carbon, Paul has demonstrated the power of Equinox to create an SOA
			fabric in which developers can mix and match components of different products
			to assemble highly customized products for their individual needs. Since late
			last year, Paul has not only evangelized WSO2â€™s specific approach, but also
			the architectural principals of creating a fully componentized SOA platform

			However, he is an excellent example of the fact that code isn't the only way
			someone in the community can make a positive contribution to the project. From
			the perspective of the Equinox p2 team, he has contributed something far more
			valuable than patches: an end-user perspective that is different from that of
			Eclipse developers. As committers we often fall victim to focusing too much on
			the user community we know best: ourselves. As a result we often tailor our
			solutions to a very narrow conception of end-user expectations and behavior.
			Therefore to have different end-user perspectives that are well thought out and
			articulated is absolutely vital to our success. Having a contributor like Miles
			providing constructive feedback early and often during development has been a
			great asset to the team. It is easy to provide criticism, but when the critique
			is polite, constructive, and thoroughly detailed, it is a refreshing change
			from the all too common slings and arrows from irate users.
			<br><br>
			From a quick search, there are about a 100 bugs Miles has created or commented
