      <P>RALEIGH, NC--April 15, 2003--Today, the Eclipse consortium announced availability of R2.1 of 
	  the popular open-tools integration platform, incorporating many changes that improve usability 
	  and performance, including workbench navigation enhancements, user-configurable key bindings, new Ant support and more flexible project layouts.  The Java development tools have been significantly upgraded with editor and debugger improvements, many new re-factorings and more.  R2.1 adds MacOS to a list of supported development platforms that already includes AIX, HP/UX, QNX, Linux, Windows and Solaris. In addition, the Eclipse community is continuing to provide and enhance tools that make it easier to build plug-ins that integrate new functions and facilities.</p>
      <P>"While our sights are set on future versions of the Eclipse Platform, we wanted to provide useful enhancements to the R2 code base," said John Wiegand, Eclipse Project Lead. "We want to retain platform stability and upward compatibility for the large community that is now releasing plug-ins based on Eclipse R2."		</p>
      <P>
A major user of tools for software development, Ericsson clearly understands the impact of Eclipse for projects with an international scope. "With major software development projects being run in 16 countries world-wide, there is great focus on sharing information between tools and between development teams," said Jaak Urmi, Corporate Director of Software Technology at Ericsson. "Eclipse is seen by Ericsson as a major initiative that will lead to the tools interoperability we need."	  </p>
	  <P> Five new supporting members have recently been welcomed to the consortium 
        that propels this multi-language, multi-platform, multi-vendor ecosystem. 
        New members include: Ericsson, Fraunhofer/FOKUS, LogicLibrary, QA Systems 
        and SilverMark. This expands the consortium to 34 supporting members and 
        adds to the momentum that Eclipse has seen with over 7 million download 
        requests logged at the eclipse.org website since November 2001. A complete 
        list of supporting member companies is available at <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/org/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.eclipse.org/org/index.html</a>.	
      </p>
      <P> A worldwide "eco-system" of tools providers and consumers is forming 
        around the Eclipse Platform. To date, more than 260 Eclipse Platform oriented 
        projects have been recognized by community sites like <a href="http://eclipse-plugins.2y.net" target="_blank">http://eclipse-plugins.2y.net</a> 
        and <a href="http://www.sourceforge.org" target="_blank">http://www.sourceforge.org</a> 
        that independently track and host Eclipse related projects. The acceptance 
        of Eclipse R2.1 is phenomenal. Within the first 48 hours of availability 
        online, the eclipse.org servers logged more than 1 terabyte of download 
        requests. </p>
      <P>
Eclipse makes it easier for technology producers and consumers to create, integrate and use software tools, saving developers time and money. Eclipse is now supported by offerings from providers of a broad range of development technologies including specialists in modeling, code generation, metadata management, testing, embedded computing, enterprise middleware, collaboration, services, research and application systems vendors.	  </p>
      <P> A growing number of offerings "Powered by Eclipse Technology" are now 
        available from member companies like Catalyst (OpenMake), Flashline (CMEE), 
        IBM (WebSphere Studio), Instantiations (CodePro Studio), MERANT (PVCS), 
        ParaSoft (Jtest), QNX Software Systems (Momentics), IBM/RATIONAL (XDE; 
        ClearCase), Teamstudio (Analyzer for Java), Telelogic (Synergy), TimeSys 
        (TimeStorm IDE) and others. Embarcadero, Genuitec, Interwoven, MacroMedia, 
        MKS, Parasoft, Sitraka, StarBase, Versant and Versata have introduced 
        commercially available Eclipse based offerings. </p>

            <P>Eclipse is an open source ecosystem of royalty-free technology 
              and a universal platform for tools integration. Eclipse-based tools 
              give developers freedom of choice in a multi-language, multi-platform, 
              multi-vendor supported environment. Eclipse delivers a plug-in based 
              framework that makes it easier to create, integrate and use software 
              tools, saving time and money. By collaborating and sharing core 
              integration technology, tool producers can concentrate on their 
              areas of expertise and the creation of new development technology. 
              The Eclipse Platform is written in the Java&#153; language, and 
              comes with extensive plug-in construction toolkits and examples. 
              It has already been deployed on a range of development workstations 
              including Linux&reg;, MacOS&reg;, QNX&reg; and Windows&reg; based 
              systems. Full details of the Eclipse community and white papers 
              documenting the design of the Eclipse Platform are available at 
              <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="_blank">http://www.eclipse.org</a>.
