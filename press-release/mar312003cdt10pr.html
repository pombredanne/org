      </UL>
      <p>RALEIGH, NC - March 31, 2003 - Developers building software for Linux, embedded and C/C++ software platforms now have access to tools and a rich integrated development environment (IDE) code base, thanks to contributions from members of the Eclipse consortium.  The Eclipse C/C++ Development Tools (CDT) project team today announced immediate availability of CDT 1.0, a major step forward in the creation of an integrated, open cross-platform IDE for C/C++ development. </p>
	  <p>The CDT project is driving the creation of best-of-breed, commercial-quality tools for the Eclipse Platform," said Sebastien Marineau, senior software architect at QNX Software Systems and project leader for the CDT. "With the release of the CDT, it's clear that support for C/C++ in Eclipse is just as strong as for Java, which is critical for Eclipse adoption into C and C++ dominated development projects such as embedded applications." </p>
	  <p>The CDT project was launched less than a year ago and was significantly advanced by a donation of source code from QNX Software Systems.  Since then, companies such as Rational, Red Hat, MontaVista, TimeSys, Tensilica, Macraigor, SAS, Programming Research and Wasabi have also joined the project, contributing additional development resources.</p>
	  <p>"The CDT project is an important initiative that will help establish Eclipse as a multi-language IDE for the development of technical and embedded applications, as well as enterprise/IT applications," said Sky Matthews, director of product management, Rational Software, IBM Software Group. "Rational's contribution of parsing technology to the C/C++ project illustrates how multiple vendors can work together to accelerate customer-driven improvements around an open-source platform."  CDT 1.0 is compatible with the latest release of Eclipse, an open platform for tools integration that provides a framework for streamlining application development. The CDT release includes two key components:</p>
	  <ul>
        <li><b>CDT Core</b> - A full-featured C/C++ development environment. It 
          includes a project builder that integrates with GNU tools and compilers; 
          a code editor that offers features such as syntax highlighting, code 
          templates and context-sensitive help; and wizards that help automate 
          mundane programming tasks. The CDT components are plug-in extensions, 
          fully integrated into the Eclipse Platform.</li>
	    <li><b>CDT Debugger</b> - A C/C++ debugger that integrates with the popular 
          GNU gdb debugger. In addition to standard features such as run control, 
          thread support, breakpoints, watchpoints and disassembly mode, the CDT 
          debugger also supports multiple concurrent debug sessions, even on heterogenous 
          processors. By integrating with gdb, the CDT debugger can support a 
          wide range of target environments including Linux, QNX&reg; Neutrino&reg;, 
          Windows and Cygwin. </li>
      </ul>
	  <p>"With this milestone, the development community is one step closer to 
        having a fully functional open cross-platform C/C++ development environment 
        for the Eclipse Platform and various deployment environments," said Skip 
        McGaughey, chairperson of the Eclipse Board of Stewards. "This will help 
        fulfill one of the ultimate goals of the broader Eclipse Tools project 
        - to foster the creation of a wide variety of robust and full-featured 
        tools for the Eclipse Platform and encourage tools from different vendors 
        to interoperate, meeting the unique needs of developers." Eclipse CDT 
        1.0 can be immediately downloaded at <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/tools/downloads.html" target="_blank">http://www.eclipse.org/tools/downloads.html</a>.

            <P>Eclipse has established an open-source ecosystem of tools providers 
              and consumers by creating technology and an open universal platform 
              for tools integration. The open-source Eclipse community creates 
              royalty-free technology as a platform for tools integration. Eclipse-based 
              tools give developers freedom of choice in a multi-language, multi-platform, 
              multi-vendor supported environment. Eclipse delivers a plug-in based 
              framework that makes it easier to create, integrate, and use software 
              tools, saving time and money. By collaborating and sharing core 
              integration technology, tool producers can concentrate on their 
              areas of expertise and the creation of new development technology. 
              The Eclipse Platform is written in the Java&#153; language, and 
              comes with extensive plug-in construction toolkits and examples. 
              It has already been deployed on a range of development workstations 
              including HP-UX&reg;, Solaris®, AIX&reg;, Linux&reg;, MAC OS X&reg;, 
              QNX&reg; Neutrino&reg; and Windows&reg; based systems. Full details 
              of the Eclipse Consortium, open-source community, The Eclipse Platform 
              and royalty-free downloads are available at <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="_blank">http://www.eclipse.org</a>.
