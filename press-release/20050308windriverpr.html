      <ul>
        <li>Joins broad ecosystem of premier industry players including IBM, Intel, 
          MontaVista and QNX for the device space</li>

	ALAMEDA, Calif. -  March 8, 2005 - Wind River Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: WIND), the global 
	leader in Device Software Optimization (DSO) and the Eclipse Foundation today announced that Wind River will propose 
	and lead an Eclipse Device Software Development Platform project, the first project specifically for device software 
	development. Wind River elevated its membership status with the Eclipse Foundation from being an add-in provider to 
	Strategic Developer and will further incorporate Eclipse-based technology into Wind River products. With the Device 
	Software Development Project, Wind River is bringing its expertise in device software development and run-time 
	solutions to the Eclipse community to foster industry standardization and innovation to help companies develop and 
	run device software better, faster, more reliably and at a lower cost. 
	</p>
	<p>

	"The goal of Eclipse is to create a universal development platform to enable global enterprises to develop software 
	more efficiently," said Mike Milinkovich, executive director, Eclipse Foundation, Inc. "Wind River has deep experience 
	in device software and will provide the vision, technology and resources to enhance the Eclipse platform specifically 
	for embedded software development. The addition of the Device Software Development Platform project will help expand 
	Eclipse's presence in embedded computing, a key focus area for the foundation as outlined in the recently unveiled 
	Eclipse Roadmap." 
	</p>
	<p>
	Eclipse has gained tremendous traction in the enterprise market and is focused on replicating this success into 
	several key areas, including embedded systems where vendors have started to adopt Eclipse technology for development 
	tools in the device space. The Device Software Development Platform project will build on this success by creating 
	an open source tools infrastructure that is supported by multiple vendors. In the future, developers will find that 
	the Device Software Development Platform enables them to easily create software that operates across a wide range of 
	operating systems, connection mechanisms and target architectures. The Device Software Development Platform will 
	initially focus on a framework and exemplary tools for target management that will enable developers to deploy, 
	debug, and analyze applications on a device as well as the configuration of operating system and middleware components. 
	</p>
	<p>
	"By bringing the Device Software Development Project to the market, Wind River will help change the way device software 
	development is done," said John Bruggeman, chief marketing officer for Wind River. "Manufacturers will now be able to 
	standardize on choice – using a widely accepted, fully integrated development platform that supports all Eclipse 
	technologies and is backed by an unprecedented ecosystem of industry-leading companies."
	</p>
	<p>
	<strong>Eclipse Strategic Developers have pledged support for the Device Software Development Platform:</strong><br />

	"Intel welcomes Wind River's participation in Eclipse and looks forward to their initiation of the new Device 
	Software Development Platform project," said Jon Khazam, vice president and general manager of Intel's Software 
	Products Division and Eclipse Foundation board member. "There is a strong interest in Eclipse-based development tools 
	for device-level software.  Wind River's efforts will help accelerate the move to a common shared infrastructure 
	among tools vendors, reducing time to market and providing greater consistency and interoperability to developers."
	</p>
	  <p> "As a founding member of Eclipse, IBM welcomes Wind River's proposal to 
        help standardize device development via the Device Software Development 
        Platform project, bringing the benefits of Wind River's experience and 
        Eclipse's open environment to the device development community," said 
        Stephen Saunders, development director, IBM Rational. "Providing a standard 
        way to build embedded applications will help accelerate software development 
        and innovation in the rapidly-growing device space." <br>
