        Eclipse Foundation and Wind River Announce Approval of Eclipse Device Software Development Platform Project </b></span></b></h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Top-level Eclipse project proposed by Wind River approved</li>
        <li>Sub-projects for target management and device debugging initiated</li>
      </ul>      
      <P>OTTAWA and ALAMEDA, Calif. &ndash; June 14, 2005 &ndash; The Eclipse Foundation, an 
	  open source community committed to the development of a universal development platform, and Wind
	  River Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:WIND), the global leader in Device Software Optimization (DSO), today
	   announced that the Device Software Development Platform (DSDP) project, the top-level Eclipse 
	   project proposed by Wind River in March of this year, has been approved by the Eclipse Board of 
	   Directors. The DSDP is the first project within Eclipse specifically created to address device 
	   software development and is designed to drive a common development platform and value into the DSO 
	   developer community. </p>
      <p>&ldquo;The Eclipse Board&rsquo;s decision to approve the Device Software Development Platform 
	  project is great news for the Eclipse community,&rdquo; said Mike Milinkovich, executive director 
	  of the Eclipse Foundation, Inc. &ldquo;The device realm is teeming with software-driven innovation, 
	  and we are looking forward to watching this project develop, mature and create even more opportunities 
	  for standardization and innovation across the device landscape.&rdquo; </p>
	  
      <p>The goal of the DSDP project is to extend the Eclipse platform in order to establish a common 
	            framework for integration of the complete set of capabilities required by device software developers 
	            and a common set of base functionality that can be enhanced and extended by the Eclipse community. A 
	            common platform makes plug-in development more efficient and allows developers to target a greater 
	            number of operating systems and devices. As project leader, Wind River is leading a growing community 
	            of vendors that collaborate on the definition and implementation of this project, including two 
	            sub-projects. As the DSDP project matures, other vendors are encouraged to propose additional 
	            sub-projects to further increase the value proposition of Eclipse for device software developers. 
	            The first two DSDP sub-projects are:
 <ul><li><strong>Target management:</strong> Project goal is to develop a common framework to manage device 
	            connections. The project will provide an API, data models and views to manage remote 
				ystems, their connections and their services. It provides an abstraction layer to 
				launch and control applications on the device without requiring specific knowledge of 
				the underlying architecture and operating system.</li>
 <br>
<li><strong>Device debugging:</strong> Project goal is to create a better API to support debugging the software running 
on a device. The project will extend the Eclipse platform with a debug model, interfaces and views that 
work with the many different debug engines to support conventional, digital signal (DSP) and network 
processors.</li>
</ul>
</p>      

<p>&ldquo;Wind River is committed to driving standards for this industry and creating solutions for 
device software optimization that add value to the development process across the development lifecycle 
and regardless of which operating system the developer chooses,&rdquo; said Tomas Evensen, chief 
technology officer, Wind River. &ldquo;By leading and driving this effort, Wind River is helping to 
form and shape the outcome of the DSDP project, and in turn, the future of our industry.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Stan Schneider, chief executive officer of Real-Time Innovations commented, &ldquo;Wind River&rsquo;s 
leadership role in creating the DSDP project will help bring participants and supporters with unique 
 valuable contributions to the project, the benefits of using tools based on DSDP will be significant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&quot;Accelerated Technology has been a leader in embedded software tools under Eclipse with our 
Nucleus EDGE product,&quot; said Robert Day, director of marketing, Accelerated Technology Division, 
Mentor Graphics. &quot;We are looking forward to contributing to the DSDP project to help bring more 
device software support into the Eclipse environment.&quot;</p>
