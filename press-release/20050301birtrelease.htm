        Eclipse Makes BIRT Modules Available </b></span></b></h1>
      <ul>
        <li>First Developer Builds of Report Designer, Report Engine and Charting Engine Ready for Download and Feedback </li>
      </ul>      
      <P>ECLIPSECON 2005, BURLINGAME, Calif.--March 1, 2005-- Actuate Corporation (NASDAQ: ACTU), the 
	  world leader in Enterprise Reporting Applications, and the Eclipse Foundation, a community 
	  committed to the implementation of a universal development platform, today announced that all 
	  of the modules currently under development for the Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools 
	  Project (BIRT) are now available. In addition, a build infrastructure has been established to 
	  provide regular builds of BIRT to the Eclipse Open Source community to allow for regular 
	  community feedback. BIRT, which was approved as a top level Eclipse project in September 2004, 
	  is the industry&rsquo;s first Open Source Business Intelligence and Reporting Technology project. 
	  BIRT version 1.0 is scheduled for release in the first half of 2005.</p>
      <p>The elements of BIRT now available include:  
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Report Object Model (ROM):</strong> which is a schema for describing the elements that make up the design of a BIRT report.</li>
        <li><strong>Eclipse Report Designer:</strong> which is an Eclipse-based desktop authoring environment that generates reports based on the ROM.</li>
        <li><strong>Eclipse Report Engine:</strong> which enables reports to be generated using the ROM designs created by the Designer.</li>
        <li><strong>Eclipse Charting Engine:</strong> which provides a rich business chart generation capability within BIRT and can also be used as a standalone charting component.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>BIRT will benefit developers and, in particular, the Eclipse Java Developer, by expanding the availability of Business Intelligence and reporting to a wider audience, and allow faster incorporation of reporting within Java applications. Developers require tools such as BIRT that are simple to use and widely applicable in order to minimize the development costs associated with building core application functions such as reporting and analysis. In addition, BIRT will promote interoperability with commercial reporting offerings by offering ROM, a report definition language that allows for the easy transfer of report definitions, making it easier for developers to migrate report designs amongst tools.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;The Eclipse community forges the path for technical excellence, innovation and extensibility within the Java world,&rdquo; said Mike Milinkovich, executive director of Eclipse Foundation, Inc. &ldquo;Availability of BIRT marks another step towards accelerating the development of Java applications that include business intelligence and reporting capabilities.&rdquo;</p>
      <p> &ldquo;The planning process for BIRT has been agile enough to embrace the feedback from our user community and has remained focused on our vision to provide the first Open Source technology to address the development needs that arise from building reporting and Business Intelligence application components,&rdquo; said Mark Coggins, senior vice president of Engineering for Actuate Corporation and Eclipse Foundation Board Member. &ldquo;We once again welcome feedback on BIRT to ensure that the BIRT Project Management Committee has remained true to its vision.&rdquo; </p>
