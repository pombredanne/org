      <P><strong>JAVA ONE (BOOTH 1534), SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.&mdash;June 27, 2005</strong>&mdash;The Eclipse Foundation 
	  today announced releases of several Eclipse open source projects that provide a platform spanning 
	  the software development lifecycle. Building on the success of the widely used Eclipse Java IDE, 
	  the Eclipse community is delivering on the vision of providing a platform for integrating 
	  software development tools, including support for testing, performance monitoring, business 
	  intelligence and reporting, Java, C/C++ and Web application development and aspect oriented 
	  programming.</p>
	  
      <p>&ldquo;Eclipse is delivering on its vision of providing a universal development platform that 
	  includes tools and frameworks spanning the entire software lifecycle,&rdquo; stated Mike 
	  Milinkovich, executive director of Eclipse Foundation. &ldquo;A lot of people know and love 
	  Eclipse as a great Java IDE. However, the real impact Eclipse has had on software development is 
	  providing the platform for ISVs to build and integrate software development tools. Developers, 
	  architects and testers benefit from an ecosystem of over 100 ISVs and hundreds of products which
	   allow development teams choice in the tools best suited to their needs.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>A new version of the core Eclipse development platform, Eclipse Platform 3.1, will be 
	  available for download the week of June 27. Over the next 30 days, other Eclipse projects will 
	  make available new releases of their technologies supported on Eclipse 3.1. As a single platform, 
	  these powerful new releases enable programmers to:</p>
	  
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Create and Deploy J2EE 1.4 Applications</strong> &ndash; New wizards and tools can be used to 
	        create and deploy J2EE applications. The leading J2EE vendors &ndash; BEA, Borland, IBM, JBoss 
	        and ObjectWeb &ndash; will use these tools as the platform for their J2EE development tools.
		</li>
		<li><strong>Deep integration with J2SE 5.0</strong> - Everything developers love about Eclipse, including 
		refactoring, quick fix, search, code formatting, will work seamlessly with J2SE 5.0 features, 
		for instance annotations and generics. 
		</li>
        <li><strong>Build Rich Client Applications</strong> &ndash; New and improved tools can be used to create rich 
		client applications on top of the Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP).
		</li>
        <li><strong>Scale Up</strong> &ndash; Significant performance improvements to the base platform and testing 
		platform will support large development teams with faster startups, more responsive user 
		interfaces and smaller memory requirements.
		</li>
        <li><strong>Develop and Extend with Ease</strong> &ndash; A major theme of the Eclipse releases is to improve 
		the usability and extensibility of the tools, including Java development tools and testing and 
		performance tools.
		</li>
        <li><strong>Create and Validate Web Services</strong> &ndash; The Eclipse Web service validation tools check 
		conformance to the WS-I profiles and are used to create the Java reference implementation of 
		the WS-I test tools.
		</li>
        <li><strong>Easily Create Web Applications</strong> &ndash; New editors allow for the easy creation of JSP, 
		HTML, XML, CSS, DTD and JavaScript files.
		</li>
        <li><strong>Streamline Testing and Performance Tuning</strong> &ndash; Tight integration with JUnit and new 
		GUI capabilities enable a more streamlined approach for unit testing and performance problem 
		isolation on the Eclipse Test and Performance Tools Platform. 
		</li>
        <li><strong>Create User Interfaces for Eclipse RCP</strong> &ndash; The Eclipse Visual Editor now supports the 
		ability to create Eclipse RCP applications. 
		</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Ant support</strong> &ndash; New debug and refactoring support for Ant scripts. Easily 
		create an Eclipse project from an Ant script and export an Ant script from Eclipse.
		</li>
        <li><strong>Leverage Aspect Oriented Programming</strong> &ndash; New AspectJ 5 release provides support for 
		J2SE 5.0 including annotations, generics and a new annotation-based development style.
		</li>
      </ul>      
	  <p>The projects that have scheduled releases are Eclipse Platform, Test and Performance Tools 
	  Platform, Web Tools Platform, Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools Platform, Eclipse 
	  Modeling Framework, Graphical Editing Framework, UML2, Visual Editor and AspectJ. For a complete 
	  list of project features and corresponding project downloads, visit <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/org/june05release/projects.html">http://www.eclipse.org/org/june05release/projects.html</a>. </p>
      
	  <p>Don Campbell, vice president, product innovation and technology, Cognos, commented, &ldquo;
	  Eclipse continues to set the standard for software development with this highly anticipated release. 
	  Our developers can take their Eclipse experience even further with a rich set of tools that simplify 
	  and streamline the development of Cognos software from beginning to end.&rdquo;</p>
      <p><strong>Broad Support from J2EE Vendors</strong></p>
      <p>&ldquo;As co-lead of the Eclipse Web Tools project, BEA has also dedicated significant technical and personnel resources to the success of the project, evidenced by this latest release,&rdquo; said Time Wagner, senior manager, Engineering, BEA Systems. &ldquo;BEA has been a strong supporter of Eclipse and we continue to believe Eclipse is an important driver of innovations to help shorten the development cycle.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Borland&rsquo;s next-generation of commercial JBuilder products will utilize Eclipse as the underlying integration framework, including the Eclipse Web Tools project,&rdquo; said Rob Cheng, director of developer solutions at Borland. &ldquo;Eclipse technology provides a proven, reliable foundation for building commercial J2EE tools on. Specifically, Borland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Peloton&rsquo; release, which will be the first of our Eclipse-based JBuilder products, will bring JBuilder&rsquo;s trademark usability, advanced collaboration features, ALM integrations and enterprise- class support to Eclipse, while still allowing developers to take advantage of all the flexibility of the open Eclipse platform and the growing ecosystem of Eclipse plug-ins.&rdquo; <br>
          <br>
          Lee Nackman, vice president, product development, IBM Rational, stated, &ldquo;Eclipse 3.1 demonstrates the growing importance and influence of Eclipse in the software industry. Eclipse 3.1 not only expands support for Java and Web development, but is also a big step toward its vision of becoming the next-generation platform for integrating tools across the development lifecycle. IBM continues its major commitment to Eclipse &ndash; both in our leading role in contributing to Eclipse development and in Eclipse&rsquo;s role as the integration platform for IBM's Software Development Platform products.&rdquo;<br>
          <br>
        &ldquo;Because of our shared open source roots and vision of bringing open source to enterprise IT, Eclipse and JBoss are a natural fit,&rdquo; said Shaun Connolly, vice president of product management, JBoss, Inc. &ldquo;JBoss has already made the Eclipse IDE and J2EE tools central to the JBoss Enterprise Middleware System and will continue to support Eclipse as an independent platform for development.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;As the initiator of the proposal and co-lead of the project, ObjectWeb is enthusiastic 
	  to see how much traction Eclipse Web Tools Platform is gaining, now attracting software vendors 
	  such as BEA and JBoss. In line with ObjectWeb&rsquo;s rationale, we see this success as beneficial
	   for the sustainable development of an ecosystem around open-source J2EE platforms, JOnAS to 
	   begin with,&rdquo; said Christophe Ney, ObjectWeb executive director and co-lead of Eclipse Web 
	   Tools Platform. &ldquo;Started one year ago with an initial code base that included the Lomboz 
	   project, we expect WTP to go a long way, and are looking forward to reinforced relationships 
	   with the Eclipse community, for example on tooling for our ESB technologies.&rdquo; </p>
