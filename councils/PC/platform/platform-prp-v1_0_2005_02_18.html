<h2>Executive Summary of Current Plan</h2>
<p>The Eclipse Platform top level project is currently working on the 3.1 
release. The Eclipse Platform, JDT, and PDE&nbsp; subsystems are now into their 4th 
major release (1.0 in Nov. 2001; 2.0 in June 2002; 2.1 in March 2003; 3.0 in 
June 2004). In addition to the major JDT upgrade to support J2SE5, the overall 
thrust of 3.1 is solidification and readying it as a platform that will support 
and sustain a broad and growing base of products and user communities. 3.1 is 
planned for late June 2005 (<a href="eclipse_project_plan_3_1_2005_02_14.html">Eclipse 
Platform 3.1 plan (February 14, 2005)</a>).</p>
<h2>Forward Looking Statement</h2>
<p>The <a href="../../themes.html">Eclipse Themes and 
Priorities</a> are the key focus areas for the features and enhancements in 
Platform Project for the year ahead. Overall, the Platform is a mature project 
and thus our focus is on enhancing, refining, and improving the existing 
features and functions rather than creating completely new subsystems. Because 
of this focus, we are more driven by the community feedback (through Bugzilla) 
than some of the other projects, and our forward look is of somewhat shorter 
duration.</p>
<p>This overall thrust will continue with the follow-up 3.2 release (<a href="eclipse_project_plan_3_2_2005_02_14.html">Eclipse 
Platform 3.2 plan (February 14, 2005)</a>). In particular, we will continue to focus on scalability, 
to ensure Eclipse also works well for everything from small projects involving a 
few individuals to large-scale IT projects with huge development organizations. 
We also want to enhance the Platform's support for integrating a wide range of 
software development lifecycle tools, such as the ones being developed the

and Performance Tools Platform project</a>, as well as for integrating the next 
tier of tools, like the ones being developed at the
<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="/webtools/" target="_top">Eclipse Web Tools Platform</a> 
and <img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="/cdt/">CDT</a> projects.</p>
<p>Three of the <a href="../../themes.html">Eclipse Themes</a> are 
especially germane to this top level project:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Scaling Up</strong> - This refers to the need for Eclipse to deal 
  with development and deployment on a larger and more complex scale. Increasing 
  complexities arise from large development teams distributed in different 
  locations, large source code bases and fragile build environments that have 
  been developed incrementally over time, the dynamic nature of new source code 
  bases and their interaction with configuration management, and build 
  environments involving many different tools and build rules.</li>
  <li><strong>Enterprise Ready</strong> - Eclipse should be improved to allow it 
  to be better used by large development organizations.</li>
  <li><strong>Design for Extensibility: Be a Better Platform</strong> - Within 
  the Eclipse community, many development projects are defining new development 
  platforms on top of the Eclipse Platform. The Eclipse Platform must evolve to 
  better support this type of usage, including providing new common 
  infrastructure and abstraction layers needed by upper platforms and adding 
  APIs to expose existing functionality only available internally so that upper 
  platforms can more readily integrate with and reuse what's already there.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are tracking the following standards and projects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>OSGi Platform R4 standard</li>
  <li>J2SE 5 Java standard</li>
  <li>coordinating with the Equinox project's investigation of security issues 
  in RCP</li>
</ul>
<p>We have a known unresolved issue in our lack of resources for supporting SWT 
on the Macintosh.</p>
