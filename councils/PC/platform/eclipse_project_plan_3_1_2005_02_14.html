<p>This document lays out the feature and API set for the next feature release
of Eclipse after 3.0, designated release 3.1.

</ul>
<p>Plans do not materialize out of nowhere, nor are they entirely static. To
ensure the planning process is transparent and open to the entire Eclipse
community, we (the Eclipse PMC) post plans in an embryonic form and revise them
throughout the release cycle.
<p>The first part of the plan deals with the important matters of release
deliverables, release milestones, target operating environments, and
release-to-release compatibility. These are all things that need to be clear for
any release, even if no features were to change.&nbsp;
<p>The remainder of the plan consists of plan items for the three projects under
the Eclipse top-level project. Each plan item covers a feature or API that is to be added to
Eclipse, or some aspect of Eclipse that is to be improved. Each plan item has
its own entry in the Eclipse bugzilla database, with a title and a concise
summary (usually a single paragraph) that explains the work item at a suitably
high enough level so that everyone can readily understand what the work item is
without having to understand the nitty-gritty detail.
<p>Not all plan items represent the same amount of work; some may be quite
large, others, quite small. Some plan items may involve work that is localized
to a single Platform component; others may involve coordinated changes to
several components; other may pervade the entire Platform. Although some plan
items are for work that is more pressing that others, the plan items appear in
no particular order.
<p>With the previous release as the starting point, this is the plan for how we
will enhance and improve it. Fixing bugs, improving test coverage,
documentation, examples, performance tuning, usability, etc. are considered routine
ongoing maintenance activities and are not included in this plan unless they
would also involve a significant change to the API or feature set, or involve a
significant amount of work. The intent of the plan is to account for all interesting feature work.
<p>The current status of each plan item is noted:
<ul>
  <li><b>Committed</b> plan item - A committed plan item is one that we have
    decided to address for the release.</li>
  <li><b>Proposed</b> plan item - A proposed plan item is one that we are
    considering addressing for the release. Although we are actively
    investigating it, we are not yet in a position to commit to it, or to say
    that we won't be able to address it. After due consideration, a proposal
    will either be committed or deferred.</li>
  <li><b>Deferred</b> plan item - A reasonable proposal that will not make it in
    to this release for some reason is marked as deferred with a brief note as
    to why it was deferred. Deferred plan items may resurface as committed plan
    items at a later point.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Deliverables"></a>Release deliverables</h2>
<p>The release deliverables have the same form as previous releases, namely:
<ul>
  <li>Source code release for Eclipse Project, available as versions tagged
    &quot;R3_1&quot; in the Eclipse Project
  <img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/">CVS
    repository</a>.</li>
  <li>Eclipse Project SDK (includes runtime binary and SDK for Platform, JDT,
    and PDE) (downloadable).</li>
  <li>Eclipse Platform runtime binary and SDK distributions (downloadable).</li>
  <li>Eclipse RCP runtime binary and SDK distributions (downloadable).</li>
  <li>JDT runtime binary and SDK distributions (downloadable).</li>
  <li>PDE runtime binary and SDK distributions (downloadable).</li>
  <li>Eclipse SDK Examples (downloadable).</li>
  <li>SWT distribution (downloadable).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Milestones"></a>Release milestones</h2>
<p>Release milestone occurring at roughly 6 week intervals exist to facilitate
coarse-grained planning and staging. The milestones are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Friday Aug. 13, 2004 - Milestone 1 (3.1 M1) - stable build</li>
  <li>Friday Sep. 24, 2004 - Milestone 2 (3.1 M2) - stable build</li>
  <li>Friday Nov. 5, 2004 - Milestone 3 (3.1 M3) - stable build</li>
  <li>Friday Dec. 17, 2004 - Milestone 4 (3.1 M4) - stable build</li>
  <li>Friday Feb. 18, 2005&nbsp; - Milestone 5 (3.1 M5) - stable build</li>
  <li>Friday Apr. 1, 2005 - Milestone 6 (3.1 M6) - stable build - API complete 
    - API freeze</li>
  <li>Friday May 13, 2005 - Milestone 7 (3.1 M7) - stable build - feature complete 
    - development freeze - lock down and testing begins</li>
</ul>
<p>The 3.1 release is targeted for late June 2005. All release deliverables will 
  be available for download as soon as the release has been tested and validated 
  in the target operating configurations listed below.</p>
<h2><a name="TargetOperatingEnvironments"></a>Target Operating Environments</h2>
<p>In order to remain current, each Eclipse release targets reasonably current
versions of the underlying operating environments.</p>
<p>Most of the Eclipse SDK is &quot;pure&quot; Java™ code and has no direct
dependence on the underlying operating system. The chief dependence is therefore
on the Java 2 Platform itself. The 3.1 release of the Eclipse Project is written
and compiled against version 1.4 of the Java 2 Platform APIs, and targeted to
run on version 1.4 of the Java 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition.</p>
<p>There are many different implementations of the Java 2 Platform running atop
a variety of operating systems. We focus Eclipse testing on a handful of popular
<span class="header">combinations of operating system and Java 2 Platform; these
are our <em>reference platforms</em>. Eclipse undoubtedly runs fine in many
operating environments beyond the reference platforms we test. However, since we
do not systematically test them we cannot vouch for them. Problems encountered
when running Eclipse on non-reference platform that cannot be recreated on any
reference platform will be given lower priority than problems with running
Eclipse on a reference platform.</span></p>
<p>Eclipse SDK 3.1 is tested and validated on the following reference platforms 
  (this list is updated over the course of the release cycle):</p>

<p>Although untested, Eclipse should work fine on other OSes that support the
same window system. For Win32: Windows 98, ME, NT, 2000, and Server 2003; SWT
HTML viewer requires Internet Explorer 5 (or higher). For GTK on other Linux
systems: version 2.2.1 of the GTK+ widget toolkit and associated librares (GLib,
Pango); SWT HTML viewer requires Mozilla 1.4GTK2. For Motif on other Linux
systems: Open Motif 2.1 (included); SWT HTML viewer requires Mozilla 1.4GTK2.</p>
<p>An early access version of Eclipse is also available for 64-bit Linux GTK.
Testing has been limited to early access 64-bit J2SEs running on AMD64
processors.</p>
<p>SWT is also supported on the QNX Neutrino operating system, x86 processor,
Photon window system, and IBM J9 VM version 2.0. Eclipse 3.1 on Windows or Linux
can be used cross develop QNX applications. (Eclipse 3.1 is unavailable on QNX
because there is currently no 1.4 J2SE for QNX.)</p>
<h4>Internationalization</h4>
<p>The Eclipse Platform is designed as the basis for internationalized products.
The user interface elements provided by the Eclipse SDK components, including
dialogs and error messages, are externalized. The English strings are provided
as the default resource bundles.</p>
<p>Latin-1 locales are supported by the Eclipse SDK on all of the above
operating environments; DBCS locales are supported by the Eclipse SDK on the
Windows, GTK, and Motif window systems; BIDI locales are supported by the
Eclipse SDK only on Windows operating environments.
<p>The Eclipse SDK supports GB 18030, the new Chinese code page standard, on
Windows XP and 2000, and Linux.
<p>German and Japanese locales are tested.</p>
<h4>BIDI support</h4>
<p>SWT fully supports BIDI on Windows (only). On Linux GTK, SWT supports entering 
  and displaying BIDI text. The widget orientation of JFace windows defaults appropriately 
  in BIDI locales on Windows (only).</p>
<p>The Eclipse SDK is a development environment targeted at technical professionals 
  - not an end user application. However, the Eclipse SDK tools will permit technical 
  professionals who are working in English to build Hebrew/Arabic end user Java 
  programs which are themselves not based on the Eclipse SDK. The BIDI support 
  in the Eclipse SDK allows a Java programmer to work with BIDI strings, code 
  comments, etc. but the Eclipse SDK itself is not designed to be localized for 
  BIDI locales and its widget orientation can not be changed.</p>
<h2><a name="Compatibility"></a>Compatibility with Previous Releases</h2>
<h3>Compatibility of Release 3.1 with 3.0</h3>
<p>Eclipse 3.1 will be compatible with Eclipse 3.0.</p>
<p><b>API Contract Compatibility:</b> Eclipse SDK 3.1 will be upwards
contract-compatible with Eclipse SDK 3.0 except in those areas noted in the
<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/porting/eclipse_3_1_porting_guide.html" target="_top"><em>Eclipse
3.1 Plug-in Migration Guide</em></a>. Programs that use affected APIs and extension points
will need to be ported to Eclipse SDK 3.1 APIs. Downward contract compatibility
is not supported. There is no guarantee that compliance with Eclipse SDK 3.1
APIs would ensure compliance with Eclipse SDK 3.0 APIs. Refer to
<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><i><a href="http://eclipse.org/eclipse/development/java-api-evolution.html">Evolving
Java-based APIs</a></i> for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that
maintain contract compatibility.</p>
<p><b>Binary (plug-in) Compatibility:</b> Eclipse SDK 3.1 will be upwards
binary-compatible with Eclipse SDK 3.0 except in those areas noted in the
<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/porting/eclipse_3_1_porting_guide.html" target="_top"><em>Eclipse
3.1 Plug-in Migration Guide</em></a>. Downward plug-in compatibility is not supported.
Plug-ins for Eclipse SDK 3.1 will not be usable in Eclipse SDK 3.0. Refer to
<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><i><a href="http://eclipse.org/eclipse/development/java-api-evolution.html">Evolving
Java-based APIs</a></i> for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that
maintain binary compatibility.
<p><b>Source Compatibility:</b> Eclipse SDK 3.1 will be upwards
source-compatible with Eclipse SDK 3.0 except in the areas noted in the
<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/porting/eclipse_3_1_porting_guide.html" target="_top"><em>Eclipse
3.1 Plug-in Migration Guide</em></a>. This means that source files written to use Eclipse
SDK 3.0 APIs might successfully compile and run against Eclipse SDK 3.1 APIs,
although this is not guaranteed. Downward source compatibility is not supported.
If source files use new Eclipse SDK APIs, they will not be usable with an
earlier version of the Eclipse SDK.
<p><b>Workspace Compatibility:</b> Eclipse SDK 3.1 will be upwards
workspace-compatible with Eclipse SDK 3.0 unless noted. This means that
workspaces and projects created with Eclipse SDK 3.0 can be successfully opened
by Eclipse SDK 3.1 and upgraded to a 3.1 workspace. This includes both hidden
metadata, which is localized to a particular workspace, as well as metadata
files found within a workspace project (e.g., the .project file), which may
propagate between workspaces via file copying or team repositories. Individual
plug-ins developed for Eclipse SDK 3.1 should provide similar upwards
compatibility for their hidden and visible workspace metadata created by earlier
versions; 3.1 plug-in developers are responsible for ensuring that their
plug-ins recognize 3.1, 3.0, 2.1, and 2.0 metadata and process it appropriately.
User interface session state may be discarded when a workspace is upgraded.
Downward workspace compatibility is not supported. A workspace created (or
opened) by a product based on Eclipse 3.1 will be unusable with a product based
an earlier version of Eclipse. Visible metadata files created (or overwritten)
by Eclipse 3.1 will generally be unusable with earlier versions of Eclipse.
<p><b>Non-compliant usage of API's</b>: All non-API methods and classes, and
certainly everything in a package with &quot;internal&quot; in its name, are
considered implementation details which may vary between operating environment
and are subject to change without notice. Client plug-ins that directly depend
on anything other than what is specified in the Eclipse SDK API are inherently
unsupportable and receive no guarantees about compatibility within a single
release much less with an earlier releases. Refer to
<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><i><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-API%20use/eclipse-api-usage-rules.html">How
to Use the Eclipse API</a></i> for information about how to write compliant
plug-ins.
<h2>Themes and Priorities</h2>
<p><strong><img border="0" src="new.gif" width="12" height="12"> </strong>The 
  changes under consideration for the next release of Eclipse Platform, JDT, and 
  PDE address major themes identified by the Eclipse Requirements Council. (The 
  theme synopses here are cut down versions of the ones in Eclipse Requirements 
  Council: Themes and Priorities dated Dec. 15, 2004 -
<a href="../../20041215EclipseTPFinalDraft.pdf">pdf)</a>. 
  The themes are not in priority order.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><img border="0" src="new.gif" width="12" height="12"> Scaling Up</strong> 
    - This refers to the need for Eclipse to deal with development and deployment 
    on a larger and more complex scale. Increasing complexities arise from large 
    development teams distributed in different locations, large source code bases 
    and fragile build environments that have been developed incrementally over 
    time, the dynamic nature of new source code bases and their interaction with 
    configuration management, and build environments involving many different 
    tools and build rules.</li>
  <li><strong><img border="0" src="new.gif" width="12" height="12"> Enterprise 
    Ready</strong> - Eclipse should be improved to allow it to be better used 
    by large development organizations.</li>
  <li><strong><img border="0" src="new.gif" width="12" height="12"> Design for 
    Extensibility: Be a Better Platform</strong> - Within the Eclipse community, 
    many development projects are defining new development platforms on top of 
    the Eclipse Platform. The Eclipse Platform must evolve to better support this 
    type of usage, including providing new common infrastructure and abstraction 
    layers needed by upper platforms and adding APIs to expose existing functionality 
    only available internally so that upper platforms can more readily integrate 
    with and reuse what's already there.</li>
  <li><b>Rich Client Platform </b>- The Eclipse RCP is a Java-based application 
    framework for the desktop. Building on the Eclipse runtime and the modular 
    plug-in story, it is possible to build applications ranging from command line 
    tools to feature-rich applications that take full advantage of SWT's native 
    platform integration and the many other reusable components that the Eclipse 
    platform provides. This theme includes work to enhance the RCP, and to provide 
    PDE support for developing and deploying RCP-based applications.</li>
  <li><b>Simple to Use</b> - The Eclipse platform needs to not only provide the 
    features that advanced users demand, but also be something that most users 
    find simple to use. This theme includes ease-of-use reviews of existing features, 
    and work that helps make Eclipse-based products simple to use for users with 
    widely-varying backgrounds and skill sets.</li>
  <li><b>Appealing to the Broader Community</b> - This theme includes work that 
    grows deeper roots into the various OS-specific communities, spreads Eclipse 
    to additional operating environments, and builds bridges to other open source 
    communities and vertical market segments</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there are a few important Eclipse Platform improvements that do 
  not naturally fit into any of the above themes.</p>
Each of the 3 projects under the Eclipse top-level project is covered in its
own section:
<ul>
  <li><a href="#Platform">Eclipse Platform project</a></li>
  <li><a href="#JDT">Java development tools (JDT) project</a></li>
  <li><a href="#PDE">Plug-in development environment (PDE) project</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For each project, the items listed reflect new features of Eclipse or areas 
  where existing features will be significantly reworked. Each item indicates 
  the components likely affected by that work item (many items involve coordinated 
  changes to several components). Numbers in parentheses link to bugzilla problem 
  reports for that plan item. 
<h2><a name="Platform">Eclipse Platform project</a></h2>
<p>The Eclipse Platform provides the most fundamental building blocks. Plan
items reflect new features of the Eclipse Platform, or areas where existing
features will be significantly reworked.</p>
<h4>Committed Items (Eclipse Platform project)</h4>
<blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Mapping logical views to physical files on disk.</strong> In some 
    cases, multiple distinct objects happen to be stored in a single file, like 
    an archive. Conversely, in other cases, something that is logically a single 
    object is stored across multiple files. This discrepancy between logical and 
    physical creates problems for common operations such as searching, comparing, 
    and versioning, which need to work in the physical realm. Eclipse should support 
    some way of mapping between a logical view and the physical organization of 
    files on disk. [Platform Core, Platform UI, Team] (<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=80396">80396</a> 
    ) [Theme: Design for Extensibility]</p>
  <p><strong>Large-scale workspaces.</strong> Some large customers have workspaces 
    containing several hundred projects. Scoped builds (added in 3.0) were a step 
    in the right direction towards making these workable. Eclipse needs to provide 
    appropriate support for large workspaces and working sets, and ensure that 
    everything scales properly. [Platform Core; Platform UI; JDT] (<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=71128">71128</a>) 
    [Theme: Scaling Up]</p>
  <p><b>Process improvements wrt performance.</b> For 3.1 we should get a firm 
    grip on speed and space performance. To do this we should (1) identify which 
    aspects are critically important performance-wise; (2) establish benchmarks 
    to quantify performance; and (3) look at ways to improve performance. By its 
    nature, it's hard to say in advance what kind of improvements we'll be able 
    to achieve, making it difficult to make performance improvements a release 
    deliverable. Instead, what we need to do for 3.1 is commit to track performance 
    from this point on. We should carry out performance reviews (1) and create 
    benchmarks (2) for every component, and for any critical aspects that span 
    components. Even if we cannot find ways to make significant performance gains 
    (3), the benchmarks are still critical to Eclipse's success to prevent backsliding 
    in the future. The work item is to improve our process with respect to performance. 
    The deliverables are the automated performance tests, the build process that 
    collects and publishes performance data covering all critical aspects of Eclipse, 
    and the commitment to leverage this data to monitor speed and space performance 
    as part and parcel of developing Eclipse. [All Eclipse components] (<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=71123">71123</a>) 
    [Theme: Scaling Up]</p>
  <p><b>Overhaul preferences.</b> The way that Eclipse deals with preferences 
    should be improved. The workbench presentation of preferences generally uses 
    a component-oriented hierarchy, which is not always the best choice for users. 
    The UI should present preferences in such a way that users can readily discover 
    them. Some preference settings have scopes (e.g., workspace-wide vs. per project). 
    The UI should help the user to visualize these scopes. For team-wide uniformity, 
    some preferences settings (e.g., compiler options) need to be shared (or imposed) 
    across teams. The UI should also facilitate this. [Platform Core; Platform 
    UI; Text; JDT UI; JDT Core] (<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=71124">71124</a>) 
    [Theme: Simple to use]</p>
  <p><b>Improve action contributions.</b> Simplify the programming model for contributing 
    menu and toolbar items to the workbench (and their corresponding appearance 
    and behavior). Improve control over menu definition and item ordering. Allow 
    the selected object in a view to override an action, e.g., Rename menu item 
    on Java element in navigator view resolves to JDT refactoring rename instead 
    of basic file rename. Maintain a strong separation between a command, its 
    handler(s) and its placement(s) in the UI. [Platform UI; Platform Text; JDT 
    UI] (<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36968">36968</a>) 
    [Theme: Design for Extensibility]</p>
  <p><b>Scalability.</b> In cases where either the target machine is resource-constrained, 
    or the number of plug-ins is large, or the size of the workspace is large, 
    the scalability of the Eclipse Platform is especially important. The work 
    involves identifying problematic areas and making changes to improve the scalability.

  <p><b>Improve capabilities.</b> Eclipse 3.0 introduced the notion of capabilities 
    and provided categories for grouping related capabilities. These capabilities 
    are used to simplify the UI by hiding functionality that is not currently 
    relevant to the user. This plan item is to improve this support. The missing 
    features center around a product's ability to successfully support higher-level 
    notions (like user roles) and control when and how capabilities get enabled.

  <p><strong>Ant editor improvements.</strong> Provide the Ant editor with comparable

<h4>Proposed Items (Eclipse Platform project)</h4>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Embedding editors and views.</b> Various plug-ins encounter problems when 
    trying to embed editors or views within other workbench parts. For example, 
    the current compare infrastructure requires a plug-in to create a separate 
    text editor for viewing changes between files. This is due to a limitation 
    in the workbench that prevents editors from being embedded inside views or 
    other controls. As a consequence, the compare editor's nested editors don't 
    support the full set of features provided by the corresponding real content-type-specific 
    editor. This represents a major usability problem: the user must switch to 
    the real editor to make changes and then return to the compare view to review 
    the changes. Eclipse should be more flexible in the ways various editors can 
    be used and reused. Improve the UI component model to support nesting of workbench 
    parts. Reduce coupling of parts to particular locations in the workbench, 
    allowing for more flexible UI configurations. [Platform UI, Compare, Platform

    [Theme: Design for Extensibility]</p>
  <p> <b>Team policies.</b> Teams of developers working together have special 
    needs for ensuring the integrity and consistency of their collective work. 
    For example, they may have policies for things like source file naming, code 
    formatting, or bug report number for change tracking. Eclipse should enable 
    tools that help achieve that integrity and consistency. Eclipse should provide 
    more access points so that complex policies can be suggested, checked, or 
    enforced. [Platform Core; Team] (<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=71126">71126</a>)

  <p> <b>Generalized undo support.</b> The Platform should define a common command 
    processing framework in order to provide a workbench-wide undo/redo facility.

    [Theme: Design for Extensibility]</p>
  <p><b>Content types.</b> The algorithm that the Eclipse Platform uses to determine 
    which editor to open is based on the file's name and simple matching rules. 
    In many cases like XML files this simple approach is not sufficient. The Platform 
    needs to provide a more robust and scalable solution based on the content 
    of the resource. [Platform UI] (<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37668">37668</a>) 
    [Theme: Design for Extensibility]</p>
  <p><b>Add critical performance instrumentation.</b> Add support for monitoring 
    performance and detecting problems in performance critical aspects of the 
    Eclipse Platform. Potential critical areas to monitor include the times to: 
    start up a plug-in, open an editor, display a menu, switch perspectives, process 
    an SWT event, process a resource change event, etc. [Platform UI; Platform 
    Core; SWT] (<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=80138">80138</a>) 
    [Theme: Scaling up]</p>
  <p><b>Initial user experience improvements.</b> Support for Welcome content 
    will be enhanced by a number of improvements: authoring of welcome content 
    will be made easier by providing easy preview of the resulting pages when 
    all the content is composed; whenever possible, help documents will be shown 
    in place to reduce the need to leave the Welcome context; transition to workbench 
    will be made less abrupt with various degrees of welcome still present for 
    the user to return; support for welcome in sophisticated stacked products 
    will be enhanced. [Platform UI] (<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=80139">80139</a>) 
    [Theme: Simple to use]</p>
  <p><b>Macro recording and playback.</b> Add a mechanism for recording a sequence 
    of user interface interactions, storing then in a file, and playing them back 
    at a later time. File playback will be made available as an action for the 
    benefit of cheat sheets and active help. [Platform UI] (<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=80140">80140</a>) 
    [Theme: Simple to use]</p>
  <p><b>Enhancements for supporting new users.</b> Following on from the work 
    done in Eclipse 3.0, we want to further improve the way Eclipse feels to new 
    users. For example: support for templates (to create projects that do something 
    useful) as well as a set of templates that ship with Eclipse SDK; support 
    for samples (enhancing sample support shipped in 3.0 and making it API); safe 
    mode (a constrained mode of running the workbench - 'training wheels' - where 
    capabilities are restricted in order to prevent common early mistakes); simpler 
    workspace chooser (where do you want your work saved?); more usable perspective 
    chooser with short description, a small image that shows the general perspective 
    layout, perspective groups by role e.g. Java Development. [Platform UI] (<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=80132">80132</a>) 
    [Theme: Simple to use]</p>
  <p><b>Help search enhancements.</b> Search will be enhanced in a number of ways. 
    Add the ability to search the workbench UI to find actions, views, perspectives, 
    etc.; to search the web in addition to local documentation; and to collate 
    results from multiple search engines queried in parallel. Improve the presentation 
    of search by exposing Help searches in wizard UI panes, and by making search 
    pervasive in the workbench. [Help, Platform UI, Search] (<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=80131">80131</a>) 
    [Theme: Design for Extensibility; Simple to Use]</p>
  <p><b>Help system improvements.</b> A number of improvements would be added 
    to the current help system to address the current problems and make help more 
    useful. Improvements include: Allow help content to appear embedded in various 
    places of the workbench (welcome, cheat sheets, help view) as a way to avoid 
    problems caused by having all Help presented in a separate window (this would 
    also entail some rework of the Tasks sections of the Eclipse help books to 
    make them suitable for presentation in a narrow window).&nbsp;Provide a hook 
    from error dialogs into help. [Help] (<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=80141">80141</a>) 
    [Theme: Design for Extensibility; Simple to Use]</p>
  <p><b>Improve cheat sheet authoring.</b> The goal is to better support authoring 
    of cheat sheets by non-programmers by allowing actions to be recorded as macros 
    to handle 'do it for me' step actions. [Platform UI] (<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=80142">80142</a>) 
    [Theme: Simple to use]</p>
  <p><b>Pervasive context help pane.</b> The Platform should provide a reusable 
    pane to show context help for the currently active context. The pane can be 
    used in various places, including views and wizard dialogs. The pane shows 
    additional help on the current context, links to help topics about it, and 
    a quick search entry. [Help, Platform UI] (<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=80143">80143</a>)

  <p><strong>RCP performance.</strong> Startup time and total space requirements 
    are key elements in the viability of Eclipse as an RCP. In the 3.1 cycle we 
    will focus on these two performance characteristics with the particular goals 
    of: reducing space required internal data structures (e.g., framework state, 
    extension registry, ...); streamlining the startup execution to get to the 
    application code faster; and providing basic support for space-efficient resource 
    bundles. [Platform Core] (<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=80145">80145</a>) 
    [Theme: Rich Client Platform; Scaling Up]</p>
  <p> <strong>RCP infrastructure.</strong> There are various improvements to the 
    RCP infrastructure to better support a widening range of uses, including: 
    improve support for preconfigured installs; and improve support for API declaration/consumption. 
    Additionally, all RCP-related plug-ins will be updated to use only classes 
    in the J2ME CDC/Foundation profile. [Platform Core; Platform UI; Update; Help]

    [Theme: Rich Client Platform]</p>
  <p><strong>OSGi. </strong>Eclipse 3.1 will include a compliant implementation 
    of the upcoming OSGi Platform R4 specification. We will also increase the 
    flexibility of the adaptor structure of the OSGi framework in order to make 
    it easier to use the Eclipse OSGi implementation on its own. [Platform Core]

    [Theme: Rich Client Platform]</p>
  <p><strong>Dynamic plug-ins.</strong> In Eclipse 3.0 it became possible to install 
    and remove plug-ins without restarting the system. In practice this is a cooperative 
    effort requiring the rest of the plug-ins in the system to respond correctly 
    to the changes. Work will be done to increase the runtime support for making 
    plug-ins dynamic-aware, including annotating plug-ins with their dynamic characteristics, 
    changing the registry data structure to use light-weight handles, and provide 
    support for tracking key objects. Other RCP plug-ins will be updated to use 
    these mechanisms. Also, develop reusable coding structures and guidelines 
    for writing dynamic-aware plug-ins. [Platform Core; Platform UI; Platform

  <p><strong>JNLP Support.</strong> It is convenient to be able to launch a Java-based 
    application from a web browser. There are various technical issues with launching 
    Eclipse using Java Web Start (JNLP). We will ensure that the simple forms 
    of JNLP-based deployment are supported, and will investigate supporting more 
    advanced solutions that could provide a higher level of integration between 
    the Eclipse component model and that of JNLP. [Platform Core] (<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=80149">80149</a>) 
    [Theme: Rich Client Platform]</p>
  <p><strong>Security.</strong> Support ongoing work in Equinox investigating 
    security. This covers items such as enabling Java 2 security managers, plug-in 
    signing, techniques and mechanisms for authentication and authorization and 
    credential stores as well as end-to-end security of the Platform install.

    [Theme: Rich Client Platform]</p>
  <p><strong>Support for launcher branding.</strong> A key step in producing an 
    RCP-based product is creating the launcher the user uses to run the product. 
    As a minimum it should have a product-specific name and icon. Currently, constructing 
    such a launcher requires a C compiler and other OS-specific tools. We will 
    investigate providing template launchers which can be instantiated by PDE 
    when assembling a product for a given OS. [SWT; PDE] (<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=80150">80150</a>)

  <p><strong>Concurrency support for debuggers.</strong> Many debug architectures 
    require communicating with a remote debug target. The debug user interface 
    needs to be robust in the face of latent and unreliable connections. To avoid 
    blocking the user interface, the debug platform will use background jobs to 
    perform operations and communicate with debuggers. [Platform Debug, JDT Debug]

  <p><strong>Provide better text editor support for RCP.</strong> The list of 
    functions to add will grow over time. The initial set includes: annotation 
    presentation and navigation, user assigned colors and fonts, spell checking, 
    user defined, persistent folding, quick diff, templates, URL detection and 
    handling. [Platform Text] (<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=80154">80154</a>)

  <img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/lang.html">new 
    Java language features</a>, including generic types, typesafe enumerations, 
    autoboxing, enhanced for loops, static imports, varargs, and annotations. 
    Supporting these new language and compiler features requires major changes 
    to the Eclipse Java compiler, to JDT Core APIs, to JDT UI, and to JDT Debug. 
    Eclipse should contain full support for developing Java programs that use 
    the new language features, including code assist, quick fixes, new wizards, 
    source actions, and refactorings. There should also be quick assists and refactorings 
    for migrating existing Java code to the new language constructs, including 
    inferring type parameters for Collections, and converting simple for loops 
    to use the enhanced for loop. [JDT Core, JDT UI, JDT Text, JDT Debug] (<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36938">36938</a>)

<h4>Proposed Items (Eclipse JDT project)</h4>
<blockquote> 
  <p>I<b>mprove program manipulation infrastructure.</b> Parts of the Java model 
    are still implemented in terms of the deprecated JDOM, an early precursor 
    of the AST facility. JDT should move to an AST-based implementation of the 
    Java model. All source and refactoring operations should be rewritten to use 
    common program manipulation infrastructure based on ASTs and AST rewriting. 
    AST creation in the presence of syntax errors should be improved to include 
    partial bindings. The goal is to support statement level recovery in the AST 
    parser. The performance of AST creation should be improved by using a special 
    parser and eliminating one internal layer of ASTs. There should also be better 
    support for navigating between a node in an AST (or an AST binding) and the 
    corresponding element in the Java model (which would benefit views that present 
    type hierarchies). [JDT Core, JDT UI] (<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=71129">71129</a>)</p>
  <p> <strong>Search enhancements.</strong> Provide additional search queries 
    to enable more precise searching; e.g., find where is a exception thrown/caught, 
    match against method parameters in reference searches. [JDT Core, JDT UI] 
    (<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=71130">71130</a>)</p>
  <p><strong>Library projects.</strong> For plug-in development, PDE distinguishes 
    between the plug-in projects you are working on (source plug-in projects) 
    and plug-in projects you are working with but not actually changing (binary 
    plug-in projects). Making this distinction afforts the user the benefits of 
    having full source for everything in their workspace where it's easily browsed 
    and searched, while permitting economies because the latter kind of projects 
    do not actually have to be (re)compiled. This work item is to support a similar 
    notion of library project for Java development in general. The user would 
    be able to flag a Java project as a library project; JDT would know how present 
    library projects appropriately at the UI, and how to deal with them more efficiently 
    using generated binaries. [JDT Core, JDT UI] (<img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=80162">80162</a>)

  <p><b>RCP support.</b> PDE currently supports developing Eclipse plug-ins, but

  <p> <strong>Improved target support.</strong> PDE manages a model of the target 
    Eclipse for which you are developing. These targets may be complex and diverse 
    and switching targets or launch configurations can be expensive. PDE will 
    be extended to support named targets, and automatically track changes to the
