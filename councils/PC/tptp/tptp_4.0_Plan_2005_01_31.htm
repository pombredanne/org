<P>The first part of this plan deals with the important matters of release 
deliverables, release milestones, target operating environments, and 
release-to-release compatibility.&nbsp; These are all things that need to be clear for 
any release, even if no features were to change.&nbsp; 
<P>The remainder of the plan consists of plan items for the four projects under 
the TPTP Top-Level Project.&nbsp; Each plan item covers a feature or API that is to 
be added to TPTP, or some aspect of TPTP that is to be improved.&nbsp; Each plan 
item has its own entry in the TPTP bugzilla database, with a title and a 
concise summary (usually a single paragraph) that explains the work item at a 
suitably high enough level so that everyone can readily understand what the work 
item is without having to understand the nitty-gritty detail. 
<P>Not all plan items represent the same amount of work; some may be quite 
large, others, quite small. Some plan items may involve work that is localized 
to a single component; others may involve coordinated changes to 
several components; other may pervade the entire project. 
<P>With the previous release as the starting point, this is the plan for how we 
will enhance and improve it.&nbsp; Fixing bugs, improving test coverage, 
documentation, examples, performance tuning, usability, etc. are considered 
routine ongoing maintenance activities and are not included in this plan unless 
they would also involve a significant change to the API or feature set, or 
involve a significant amount of work. The intent of the plan is to account for 
all interesting feature work.

</ul>
<P>Most of the TPTP SDK is "pure" Java&#8482; code and has no direct dependence on 
the underlying operating system.&nbsp; The chief dependence is therefore on the Java 2 
Platform itself.&nbsp; The TPTP 4.0 release is written and compiled 
against version 1.4 of the Java 2 Platform APIs, and targeted to run on version 
1.4 of the Java 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition.</P>
<P>There are many different implementations of the Java 2 Platform running atop 
a variety of operating systems. We focus TPTP testing on a handful of popular 
<SPAN class=header>combinations of operating system and Java 2 Platform; these 
are our <EM>reference platforms</EM>.&nbsp; TPTP undoubtedly runs fine in many 
operating environments beyond the reference platforms we test.&nbsp; However, since we 
do not systematically test them we cannot vouch for them.&nbsp; Problems encountered 
when running TPTP on non-reference platforms that cannot be recreated on any 
reference platform will be given lower priority than problems with running 
TPTP on a reference platform.</SPAN></P>
<P>TPTP SDK 4.0 is tested and validated on the following reference platforms 
(this list may be updated over the course of the release cycle):</P>

<P>Although untested, TPTP should work fine on other OSes that support the same 
window system.</P>
<H4>Internationalization</H4>
<P>TPTP is designed as the basis for internationalized products. 
The user interface elements provided by the TPTP SDK components, including 
dialogs and error messages, are externalized. The English strings are provided 
as the default resource bundles.</P>
<P>Latin-1 locales are supported by the TPTP SDK on all of the above 
operating environments; DBCS locales are supported by the TPTP SDK on the 
Windows, GTK, and Motif window systems; BIDI locales are supported by the 
TPTP SDK only on Windows operating environments. 
<P>The TPTP SDK supports GB 18030, the new Chinese code page standard, on 
Windows XP and 2000, and Linux. 
<P>German and Japanese locales are tested.</P>
<H2><A name=Compatibility></A>Compatibility with Previous Releases</H2>
<P>TPTP 4.0 will be compatible with TPTP 4.0.&nbsp; The following specifies 
details of the various aspects of release compatibility.</P>
<ul>
	<li>
	<P style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 5px"><B>
	API Contract Compatibility:</B> TPTP SDK 4.0 will be upwards 
contract-compatible with TPTP SDK 3.3. Downward contract compatibility is not supported. There is no guarantee 
that compliance with TPTP SDK 4.0 APIs would ensure compliance with TPTP SDK 3.3 APIs. Refer to
    <img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><I><A 
href="http://eclipse.org/eclipse/development/java-api-evolution.html">Evolving 
Java-based APIs</A></I> for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that 
maintain contract compatibility.</P></li>
	<li>
	<P style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 5px"><B>
	Binary (plug-in) Compatibility:</B> TPTP SDK 4.0 will be upwards 
binary-compatible with TPTP SDK 4.0. Downward plug-in 
compatibility is not supported. Plug-ins for TPTP SDK 4.0 will not be usable 
in TPTP SDK 3.3. Refer to
    <img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><I><A 
href="http://eclipse.org/eclipse/development/java-api-evolution.html">Evolving 
Java-based APIs</A></I> for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that 
maintain binary compatibility. 
</li>
	<li>
	<P style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 5px"><B>
	Source Compatibility:</B> TPTP SDK 4.0 will be upwards 
source-compatible with TPTP SDK 3.3. This means that 
source files written to use TPTP SDK 3.3 APIs might successfully compile and 
run against TPTP SDK 4.0 APIs, although this is not guaranteed. Downward 
source compatibility is not supported. If source files use new TPTP SDK APIs, 
they will not be usable with an earlier version of the TPTP SDK. </li>
	<li>
	<P style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 5px"><B>
	Workspace Compatibility:</B> TPTP SDK 4.0 will be upwards 
workspace-compatible with TPTP SDK 3.3 unless noted. This means that 
workspaces and projects created with TPTP SDK 3.3 can be successfully opened 
by TPTP SDK 4.0 and upgraded to a 4.0 workspace. This includes both hidden 
metadata, which is localized to a particular workspace, as well as metadata 
files found within a workspace project (e.g., the .project file), which may 
propagate between workspaces via file copying or team repositories. Individual 
plug-ins developed for TPTP SDK 3.1 should provide similar upwards compatibility 
	for their hidden and visible workspace metadata created by earlier versions; 
	4.0 plug-in developers are responsible for ensuring that their 
plug-ins recognize earlier version metadata and process it appropriately. 
User interface session state may be discarded when a workspace is upgraded. 
Downward workspace compatibility is not supported. A workspace created (or 
opened) by a product based on TPTP 4.0 will be unusable with a product based 
an earlier version of TPTP. Visible metadata files created (or overwritten) 
by TPTP 4.0 will generally be unusable with earlier versions of TPTP. </li>
	<li><B>Non-compliant usage of API's</B>: All non-API methods and classes, and 
certainly everything in a package with "internal" in its name, are considered 
implementation details which may vary between operating environment and are 
subject to change without notice. Client plug-ins that directly depend on 
anything other than what is specified in the TPTP SDK API are inherently 
unsupportable and receive no guarantees about compatibility within a single 
release much less with an earlier releases. Refer to
    <img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><I><A 
href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-API%20use/eclipse-api-usage-rules.html">How 
to Use the Eclipse API</A></I> for information about how to write compliant 
plug-ins.

	</ul>
<H2><a name="Themes"></a>Themes</H2>
<P>The TPTP PMC adopted and specialized the following Eclipse themes which 
represent the key focus areas for TPTP enhancements in the year ahead.</P>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 5px"><b>Scaling Up -</b><span lang="EN-GB">
		</span>TPTP will work to enhance the support of large data volumes and 
		processing rates in areas such as data collection, user interface and in 
		the persistence of trace, log and statistical models and execution 
		histories.</li>
		<li>
		<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 5px"><b>Enterprise Ready </b>- 
		Hooks will be provided within the TPTP infrastructure to link testing 
		tools to requirements tracking tools and defect tracking tools, thus 
		embedding them effectively in enterprise development cycles. Changes to 
		the data collection layers will increase interoperability with 
		enterprise security infrastructure. In addition, there will be 
		progressive adoption of the TPTP tools and infrastructure as a test 
		platform for the project itself, which is in turn likely to drive 
		refinements into the tools. An increased focus on whole-project 
		integration testing will ensure effective interoperability amongst all 
		TPTP components and the rest of the Eclipse environment.</li>
		<li>
		<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 5px"><b>Design for 
		Extensibility: Be a Better Platform</b> - There will be a wide range of 
		activities within TPTP to externalize APIs and define extension points, 
		making the infrastructure more flexible, and more generic in 
		application.</li>
		<li>
		<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 5px"><b>Simple to Use</b> - The 
		existing TPTP tools were conceived as samples, rather than as exemplary, 
		they are deficient in many areas of usability and in some cases lacking 
		in function. The plan is that within the domains which they target they 
		will provide a high-quality user experience out of the box. We will 
		focus on ease of use through enhanced user documentation, tutorials, 
		white papers, demonstrations, and a wide range of enhancements to the 
		user interface to streamline basic processes and clarify concepts and 
		terminology.</li>
		<li>
		<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 5px"><b>Enable Consistent 
		Multi-language Support</b> - In TPTP a significant effort will be 
		applied in extending coverage of the trace models to represent C/C++ 
		programs and to handle protocol activity (specifically HTTP) 
		consistently with program activity. There will also be C/C++ APIs 
		provided to the data collection and control layers.</li>
		<li>
		<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 5px"><b>Appealing to the Broader 
		Community</b> - A range of initiatives will be taken to broaden the 
		community of potential and actual users of TPTP. Technically this will 
		include additional integration of open source test tool technologies 
		based on JUnit, and the various hooks to JUnit in the JDT, more data 
		collection agents &#8211; particularly focusing on open source technologies, 
		and additional operating system and hardware platforms from which data 
		can be collected. There will be additional marketing and an extensive 
		outreach program to the Eclipse community for additional contribution 
		and adoption.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2><a name="Projects"></a>Projects</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The TPTP project is is comprised 
	of four, managed in a coordinated fashion, across which the plans items are 
	allocated.&nbsp; TPTP subprojects include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 5px"><b>TPTP Platform Project </b>- 
		Provides common infrastructure in the areas of user interface, EMF based 
		data models, data collection and communications control, as well as 
		remote execution environments. Additionally, the Platform provides 
		extension points for leveraging or extending these capabilities in 
		solution specific tooling or runtimes. This includes Eclipse workbench 
		plug-ins as well as runtime plug-ins on a target and optionally remote 
		system.</li>
		<li>
		<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 5px"><b>Testing Tools Project
		</b>- Provides specializations of the TPTP Platform for testing (e.g. 
		test editors, trace/test conversion support), and exemplary extensible 
		tools for specific testing environments. Initially this includes three 
		test environments: JUnit, manual, and URL testing. These specializations 
		provide optimized editing and reporting experiences for these use cases. 
		In the cases where a unique runtime or an implementation of a 
		testability interface is required, it is also developed in the project. 
		For example, the manual test execution environment provides a remotely 
		managed user interface specifically for collecting manual test progress. 
		This manual user interface is unique from the common execution 
		environment for JUnit and URL testing. . </li>
		<li>
		<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 5px"><b>Tracing &amp; Profiling 
		Tools Project</b> - Extends the TPTP Platform with specific data 
		collection for Java and distributed applications that populate the 
		common trace model, additional language and protocol support is 
		anticipated. There are also viewers and analysis services that draw data 
		from the common trace model. Capabilities are provided to collect and 
		analyze heap and stack information as well as generic toolkits for 
		instrumenting running applications..</li>
		<li>
		<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>Monitoring Tools Project
		</b>- Extends the TPTP Platform for collecting, analyzing, aggregating, 
		and visualizing data that can be captured in the log and statistical 
		models. The typical examples are the collection of system or application 
		resources such as CPU or memory utilization and support for the viewing, 
		aggregation, and analysis of that data. Logs can also be transformed 
		into a common format and model allowing for symptom and pattern 
		analysis. The correlation of the data in these models is of particular 
		interest when it is associated with other model instances of statistical 
		or log data as well as traces and tests.. </li>
