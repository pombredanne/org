      <h3><a name="compatibility">Compatibility of Release 3.1 with 3.0</a></h3>
      <p>GEF 3.1 will be upwards compatible with GEF 3.0 to the
greatest extent possible. We anticipate a small number of areas where
maintaining compatibility would not be in the best interests
of GEF or its clients. All such exceptions will be noted in the 3.1
release notes so that clients can assess the impact of these changes on
their plug-ins and products.</p>
      <p><b>API Contract Compatibility:</b> GEF 3.1 will be upwards
contract-compatible with GEF 3.0 unless noted. This means that programs
in full compliance with contracts specified in 3.0 APIs will
automatically be in full compliance with 3.1 APIs. Refer to
      <img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><i><a
 href="http://eclipse.org/eclipse/development/java-api-evolution.html">Evolving Java-based APIs</a></i> for a discussion of the kinds of API
changes that maintain contract compatibility.</p>
      <p><b>Binary (plug-in) Compatibility:</b> GEF 3.1 will be upwards
binary-compatible with GEF 3.0 unless noted. This means that plug-ins
built for GEF 3.0 will continue to work correctly in 3.1 without
change. Plug-ins with hard-coded references in their plug-in manifest
file to the 3.0 version of GEF plug-ins will work in 3.1 provided the
version match rule is "greaterOrEqual" or "compatible" (the default);
references using "perfect" or "equivalent" match rules will be broken.
Refer to <img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><i><a
 href="http://eclipse.org/eclipse/development/java-api-evolution.html">Evolving Java-based APIs</a></i> for a discussion of the kinds of API
changes that maintain binary compatibility.</p>
      <p><b>Source Compatibility:</b> GEF 3.1 will be upwards
source-compatible with GEF 3.0 to the greatest extend possible. This means that source
files written to use 3.0 APIs can often be successfully compiled and run
against GEF 3.1 APIs. Since source incompatibilities are easy to deal
with, maintaining source compatibility is considered much less
important than maintaining contract and binary compatibility.&nbsp; The addition 
		of a single method anywhere could be an incompatible source change.&nbsp; 
		For this reason, source-incompatibilities will not be noted.</p>
      <p><b>Non-compliant usage of API's</b>: All non-API methods and
classes, and certainly everything in a package with "internal" in its
name, are considered implementation details which may vary between
operating environment and are subject to change without notice. Client
plug-ins that directly depend on anything other than what is specified
as API are inherently unsupportable and receive no guarantees about
compatibility within a single release much less with an earlier
releases. Refer to <img border="0" src="../external.gif" width="20" height="16"><i><a
 href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-API%20use/eclipse-api-usage-rules.html">How to Use the Eclipse API</a></i> for information about how to write
compliant plug-ins.</p>

		<h4>Committed Items</h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p><b>ShortestPathConnectionRouter.</b> A draw2d connection router 
			which will take advantage of the shortest path routing algorithm 
			introduced in 3.0.&nbsp; Such a router requires layout notification 
			from a container figure defining the obstacles which are being 
			avoided by the router.&nbsp; The router should also support an 
			optional list of user BendPoints. [draw2d]</p>
			<p dir="ltr"><b>Palette Keybindings.</b> The user should be able to 
			activate frequently used tools via a customizable keybinding.&nbsp; 
			There are limitation in the keybinding service which must be 
			overcome to implement this feature, especially when the palette is 
			in a view.&nbsp; It must&nbsp; be possible to define Keybindings 
			programmatically for unknown extensions.&nbsp; It should be possible 
			to set the keybinding without necessarily using the keybinding 
			preference page. [GEF, UI]</p>
			<p><b>Constrained horizontal ordering for nodes in a DG.</b>&nbsp; 
			Ability constraint the left-to-right ordering of nodes in a directed 
			graph.&nbsp; If a node has a non-negative constraint, then its LTOR 
			order in a given row will be constrained among other nodes with 
			non-negative constraints.&nbsp; This can be used to guarantee the 
			order of subgraphs or nodes when it has meaning, for example when 
			visually representing a switch statement or exception handling. 
			[draw2d]</p>
			<p dir="ltr"><b>Org-Chart layout algorithm.</b>&nbsp; Laying out a 
			strict hierarchy of nodes in a tree layout similar to an org chart.&nbsp; 
			Two modes of layout are already demonstrated in the draw2d.examples 
			project.&nbsp; But, the algorithm needs to run in standalone mode, 
			and flexible figures should be available which use the standalone 
			algorithm. [draw2d]</p>
			<p dir="ltr"><b>Snapping Bendpoints.</b>&nbsp; Bendpoints should 
			snap-to-grid when the grid is displayed.&nbsp; They should also snap 
			to guides if possible. [GEF]</p>
			<p dir="ltr"><b>Performance improvements for ConnectionRouter.</b>&nbsp; 
			Connection routers re-route whenever a connection anchor indicates 
			that this is necessary.&nbsp; Currently this occurs too often.&nbsp; 
			We will introduce a new notification for coordinate system changes 
			which will reduce the frequency of connection re-routing. [draw2d]</p>
			<p dir="ltr"><b>EMF based GEF example.</b>&nbsp; An example which 
			uses an EMF model.&nbsp; The example will be an editor for ecore 
			itself, allowing the user to diagram ecore classes and packages 
			visually.&nbsp; The model will be split between business and view 
			data.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>Proposed Items</h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p dir="ltr"><b>WYSIWYG Text Editing.</b>&nbsp; Textual document 
			editing for GEF.&nbsp; Keyboard input, navigation, and mouse 
			selection support via new tools and viewers.&nbsp; BiDi support, 
			etc.&nbsp; Requires a new example which exercises the new API. [GEF, 
			draw2d]</p>
			<p dir="ltr"><b>Better and faster horizontal coordinate assignment 
			in DG.</b>&nbsp; Assigning horizontal coordinates to nodes in a 
			directed graph layout is computationally expensive.&nbsp; There is a 
			linear algorithm for directed graphs which produces results of 
			similar quality.&nbsp; The algorithm could probably be extended to 
			compound directed graphs.</p>
			<p dir="ltr"><b>Orthogonal Connection Router and Handles.</b>&nbsp; 
			A connection router which routes connections using only horizontal 
			and vertical line segments.&nbsp; The user should be able to grab a 
			segment and move it, which updates the constraint used for the 
			connection. [GEF, draw2d]</p>
			<p dir="ltr"><b>Better keyboard traversal order for connection 
			EditParts.</b>&nbsp; When selecting connections via the keyboard 
			using forward-slash, the order is based on the model order.&nbsp; 
			The model order is often not important and does not correspond to 
			the visual arrangement of the connections.&nbsp; A better order 
			could be used which is based on visual layout. [GEF]</p>
			<p dir="ltr"><b>New Layout Managers.</b>&nbsp; Layout managers for 
			draw2d such as a &quot;desktop&quot; XY Layout, and a Grid or Table layout 
			similar to SWT's GridLayout.&nbsp; A desktop layout will anchor 
			figures by their top-center location instead of top-left.&nbsp; That 
			way, their width can change without affecting the location of a 
			centered icon.</p>
			<p dir="ltr"><b>Print Dialog.</b> a dialog for setting print options 
			such as page margin and fit-to-page settings.</p>
			<p dir="ltr"><b>Marker Display.</b> Investigate the display of 
			markers in a graphical viewer.</p>
			<p dir="ltr"><b>Commonly used figures.</b>&nbsp; Provide common 
			figures such as sticky note or UML class figure.</p>
