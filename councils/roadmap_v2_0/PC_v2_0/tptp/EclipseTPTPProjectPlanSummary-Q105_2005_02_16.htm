<p style="margin-top: 0"><font size="1">* Follow links above for access to the 
respective release plan summaries.</font></p>
<P>Our general release philosophy is to release TPTP coincident with Eclipse 
Platform releases and provide more frequent interim releases as applicable.&nbsp; 
This generally translates to an annual major release in June, quarterly minor 
releases thereafter (September, December, March), and maintenance releases as 
needed.&nbsp; </P>
<P>In addition to the above releases approved by the TPTP PMC and Planning 
Group, we have recently commenced the planning cycle for our follow-on TPTP 4.1 minor 
release targeted for September 2005 and we will publish such plan information 
when available.</P>

<h2>Forward Looking Statement</h2>
<p>The TPTP PMC adopted and specialized the following
<a href="../../themes.html">Eclipse Themes and 
Priorities</a> which 
represent the key focus areas for TPTP enhancements in releases for the year 
ahead:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 5px"><b>Scaling Up -</b><span lang="EN-GB">
	</span>TPTP will work to enhance the support of large data volumes and 
	processing rates in areas such as data collection, user interface and in the 
	persistence of trace, log and statistical models and execution histories.
	</li>
	<li>
	<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 5px"><b>Enterprise Ready </b>- 
	Hooks will be provided within the TPTP infrastructure to link testing tools 
	to requirements tracking tools and defect tracking tools, thus embedding 
	them effectively in enterprise development cycles. Changes to the data 
	collection layers will increase interoperability with enterprise security 
	infrastructure. In addition, there will be progressive adoption of the TPTP 
	tools and infrastructure as a test platform for the project itself, which is 
	in turn likely to drive refinements into the tools. An increased focus on 
	whole-project integration testing will ensure effective interoperability 
	amongst all TPTP components and the rest of the Eclipse environment. </li>
	<li>
	<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 5px"><b>Design for Extensibility: 
	Be a Better Platform</b> - There will be a wide range of activities within 
	TPTP to externalize APIs and define extension points, making the 
	infrastructure more flexible, and more generic in application. </li>
	<li>
	<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 5px"><b>Simple to Use</b> - The 
	existing TPTP tools were conceived as samples, rather than as exemplary, 
	they are deficient in many areas of usability and in some cases lacking in 
	function. The plan is that within the domains which they target they will 
	provide a high-quality user experience out of the box. We will focus on ease 
	of use through enhanced user documentation, tutorials, white papers, 
	demonstrations, and a wide range of enhancements to the user interface to 
	streamline basic processes and clarify concepts and terminology. </li>
	<li>
	<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 5px"><b>Enable Consistent 
	Multi-language Support</b> - In TPTP a significant effort will be applied in 
	extending coverage of the trace models to represent C/C++ programs and to 
	handle protocol activity (specifically HTTP) consistently with program 
	activity. There will also be C/C++ APIs provided to the data collection and 
	control layers. </li>
	<li>
	<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 5px"><b>Appealing to the Broader 
	Community</b> - A range of initiatives will be taken to broaden the 
	community of potential and actual users of TPTP. Technically this will 
	include additional integration of open source test tool technologies based 
	on JUnit, and the various hooks to JUnit in the JDT, more data collection 
	agents &#8211; particularly focusing on open source technologies, and additional 
	operating system and hardware platforms from which data can be collected. 
	There will be additional marketing and an extensive outreach program to the 
	Eclipse community for additional contribution and adoption. </li>
</ul>
    <p>We are tracking and supporting the following standards and projects: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>We support the <b>OMG UML2 Test Profile</b> and have implemented an 
      early draft of the model. We are assessing the need to change our test 
      model in a future release. Additionally, our members have participated in 
      the definition of the OMG effort to define this model. </li>
      <li>We provide an implementation of <b>Common Base Event</b> which is 
      currently a proposed standard submission to Oasis. Once approved we will 
      implement the changes needed to comply with the specification. We also 
      provide an adaptor for the Eclipse Platform so that all Eclipse tools can 
      become producers of this logging format and leverage our analysis tooling.
      </li>
      <li>In a future release we intend to provide a <b>JVMTI (JSR 163)</b> 
      based data collector to replace our current <b>JVMPI</b> agent. We are 
      currently pursuing contributors to get this into our plans. This will 
      improve the install experience as well as improve our coexistence with 
      other infrastructure tooling. </li>
      <li>We are actively working with the Eclipse Platform team support to add 
      support for logical resources and record based resources in order to 
      provide more enterprise and scalable team solutions. This is in line with
      <b>JSR 147 </b>(logical and record resources) and <b>JSR 170 </b>(logical 
      resources). </li>
      <li>We are also driving extension of our testing and execution frameworks 
      based on other de facto based standards that derive from <b>JUnit</b>, 
      such as <b>HTTPUnit</b> and <b>Abbot</b>.</li>
    </ul>
