This document describes the roadmap for the Eclipse Web Tools Platform (WTP) Project.
The content of each release is determined by a combination of both specific requirements derived from the
Eclipse community and some general principles.
The following general principles apply to all releases:

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Eclipse Platform Currency</strong>

<p>
The WTP project will take advantage of new capabilities as they are
added to the Eclipse Platform in order to achieve user interface consistency and seamless integration.
WTP releases will closely follow Eclipse releases so that WTP users can quickly take advantage the latest Eclipse platform innovations.
WTP operating system coverage will match that of the Eclipse platform.
</p>

<p>
The WTP will extend the Eclipse Platform with the addition of server runtime environments and Web and J2EE
development artifacts such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, JSP, XML, WSDL, J2EE Deployment Descriptors, etc.
The WTP user interface will extend all the standard Eclipse Platform functions such as content assist, quick fixes,
refactoring, and semantic search to these new artifacts in a seamless, consistent fashion.
</p>

</li>

<li>
<strong>WTP API Definition</strong>

<p>
A key goal of the WTP project is the definition of a stable, robust, functional API that add-in providers
can build on. 
Our objective is ensure that plug-ins that use the WTP 1.0 API will run without recompilation on future WTP releases.
Plug-ins that use internal WTP code may require modification to run in future releases.
The definition of APIs for the initial code base will take several releases to complete,
and new APIs will continue to be introduced as the project grows.
</p>

</li>

<li>
<strong>Web and J2EE Standards Currency</strong>

<p>
The scope of the WTP project includes Web and J2EE standards, and these standards are currently
undergoing rapid evolution, especially in the area of XML and Web services. 
Each release of WTP will both upgrade support for exisiting key standards
and introduce new support for industrially relevant emerging standards.

<li>
<strong>Milestone Process</strong>

<p>
The overall release content is staged into a sequence of milestones. 
The detailed content of each milestone is defined by a planning process.
Each milestone contains a subset of stable function that supports a set of development scenarios. 
Milestone builds are suitable for end user testing and feedback. Milestones are scheduled bimonthly,
but are not defined by the schedule. The milestone release is declared when all the high priority functions are complete.
</p>

</li>

<li>
<strong>Continuous Integration</strong>

<p>
The WTP project practices continuous integration. 
The complete product is built nightly. 
The build process include the execution of
unit tests, performance tests, and API violation and breakage scans.
Nightly builds may be unstable and are mainly of interest to WTP developers.
</p>

<p>
Once a week, the code base base is stabilized in an integration build.
Integration builds are suitable for testing and for evaluation by other projects that use WTP.
</p>

<p>
Approximately bimonthly, a milestone build is declared.
As mentioned above, milestone builds are declared when the high priority items are complete.
Milestone builds are of interest to WTP users.
</p>

<p>
WTP product releases occur approximately annually in conjunction with Eclipse product releases.
Our goal is to follow Eclipse releases as soon as possible so that other projects can move to new Eclipse and WTP releases at the same time.
In practice, we anticipate a two to four week period between Eclipse and WTP releases, during which time WTP will perform testing on the final Eclipse
release.

WTP 1.0 is the initial release. 
The goal of this release is to integrate the initial code contributions and define an initial API. 
The high priority APIs are the Server Tools and Flexible Project Layout.
Other API will be defined on a best effort basis, as permitted by the available resource and schedule.
Most elements of the API will be defered to WTP 1.1.
WTP 1.0 is based on Eclipse 3.1.
The milestone plan for WTP 1.0 is as follows:
