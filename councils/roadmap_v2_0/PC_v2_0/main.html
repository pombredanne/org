      The <img border="0" src="external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a href="../../documents/Eclipse Development Process 2003_11_09 FINAL.pdf">Eclipse Development Process</a> calls for the creation of three Councils: Requirements, Planning and Architecture. Together, these Councils are responsible for the creation and maintenance of the Eclipse Roadmap. When approved by the Board, the intent of the Eclipse Roadmap is to communicate the directions in which the Eclipse community will be taking its projects over the next year. New projects started during the life of a Roadmap are expected to be consistent and complementary to the Roadmap.</p>
      
<p>This document is the first draft of the Eclipse Platform Release Plan. We welcome 
  your feedback on the <a href="news://news.eclipse.org/eclipse.foundation">Eclipse 
  Foundation Newsgroup</a>. </p>
      <p>The Eclipse community is organized into six top-level projects, each of which has provided its release plans using the links below. </p>
      <ul>
         <li><a href="platform/platform-prp-v1_0_2005_02_18.html">Platform Project 
         (Summary Plan v1.0, February 18, 2005)</a></li>
         <li><a href="tools/Tools%20Project_1_0.htm">Tools Project</a></li>
         <li><a href="tptp/EclipseTPTPProjectPlanSummary-Q105_2005_02_16.htm">Test and Performance Tools Platform Project 
         (February 16, 2005)</a></li>
         <li><a href="wtp/wtp-ptp-v1_0_2005_02_16.html">Web Tools Platform Project 
         (Summary Plan v1.0, February 16, 2005) </a></li>
         <li><a href="birt/Eclipse_BIRT_Plan_R1_0_2005_02_18.html">Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools Project 
         (Summary Plan v1.0, February 18, 2005)</a> </li>
         <li>As it is comprised primarily of incubators, research, and education projects, the Technology project is not formally part of the Platform Release Plan. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Other projects will be added over time.</p>
