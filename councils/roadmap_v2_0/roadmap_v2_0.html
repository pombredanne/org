	href="../../documents/Eclipse Development Process 2003_11_09 FINAL.pdf">Eclipse
Development Process</a>, this document describes the Eclipse Roadmap.</p>
<p>The Roadmap is intended to be a living document which will see future
iterations. This document is the second version of the Eclipse Roadmap,
and is labeled as version 1.0. In order to preserve this document
while the underlying information evolves, the pages have been frozen by
copying them from their original project hosted locations. Each frozen
document is labeled with its version and date and includes a link back
to its &quot;live&quot; version. Links that go outside this frozen copy
are marked with the <img border="0" src="PC_v2_0/external.gif"
	width="20" height="16"> icon to inform the reader that that information
may have changed since this document has written.</p>
<p>The goal of the Roadmap is to provide the Eclipse ecosystem with
guidance and visibility on the future directions of the Eclipse open
source community. An important element in this visibility is that the
Roadmap determines what projects will be accepted by Eclipse during the
life of this revision of the Roadmap. In other words, new projects must
be consistent with the Roadmap. This does not mean that every new
project must be explicitly envisaged by the Roadmap. It does mean that
new projects cannot be inconsistent with the stated directions of
Eclipse. In particular, Eclipse expects that incubator projects created
in the Technology PMC will cover areas not explicitly described in the
Roadmap.</p>
<p>There are four main sections to this document:</p>
<ol>
	<li>This Preamble provides some background on Eclipse and the
	Foundation, and identifies the strategic goals of Eclipse. It also
	provides a brief overview of the scope of future projects anticipated
	within the Eclipse open source community. <br>
	</li>
	<li>The <a href="themes.html">Themes and Priorities</a> which has been
	developed by the Eclipse Requirements Council. <br>
	</li>
	<li>The <a href="PC_v2_0/main.html">Platform Release Plan</a> which has been
	developed by the Eclipse Planning Council.<br>
	</li>
	<li>The <a href="AC_v2_0/main.html">Architecture Plan</a> which has been

As defined on our website, the role of the Foundation is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Eclipse Foundation is a non-profit corporation formed to
advance the creation, evolution, promotion, and support of the Eclipse
Platform and to cultivate both an open source community and an ecosystem
of complementary products, capabilities, and services.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As defined in our <img border="0" src="PC_v2_0/external.gif"

Purposes of the Eclipse Foundation are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Eclipse technology is a vendor-neutral, open development
platform supplying frameworks and exemplary, extensible tools (the
&ldquo;Eclipse Platform&rdquo;). Eclipse Platform tools are exemplary in
that they verify the utility of the Eclipse frameworks, illustrate the
appropriate use of those frameworks, and support the development and
maintenance of the Eclipse Platform itself; Eclipse Platform tools are
extensible in that their functionality is accessible via documented
programmatic interfaces. The purpose of Eclipse Foundation Inc., (the
&ldquo;Eclipse Foundation&rdquo;), is to advance the creation,
evolution, promotion, and support of the Eclipse Platform and to
cultivate both an open source community and an ecosystem of
complementary products, capabilities, and services. <br>

<br>
<div class="content">
<p><br>
There are many open source projects and open source communities in
existence today. Eclipse has strong relationships with many of these.
There are, however, three key differentiators between Eclipse and other
open source communities.</p>
<ol>
	<li>The Eclipse Development Process describes a well-defined process
	whereby Eclipse will build and maintain a Roadmap which describes the
	future directions of Eclipse. The attempt to co-ordinate the activities
	of a large open source community with many projects by requiring its
	participants to share a common vision and release roadmap is
	unprecedented. This will create a predictable environment that is
	essential for the commercialization of the Eclipse technology.<br>
	</li>
	<li>Eclipse explicitly and consciously fosters the commercial adoption
	of its technologies. Although many other open source projects (e.g. <img
		border="0" src="PC_v2_0/external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a
		href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a>, <img border="0"
		src="PC_v2_0/external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a
		href="http://www.apache.org">Apache</a>, etc.) are enormously
	successful in terms of commercial adoption, none directly support it to
	the degree that Eclipse does. One concrete example of this is the
	requirement that all Members ship a commercial offering based upon,
	or with, Eclipse technology within a year of joining the Foundation.<br>
	</li>
	<li>A technical architecture that includes an extensible platform that
	when combined with a flexible licensing model make it easy to add
	commercial offering and encourage a third party ecosystem.</li>
</ol>
<p>These differentiators are positives. They help define Eclipse, and
give it a unique presence in the broader open source community.<br>
<br>
</p>
</div>
<div id="section_header">Strategic Goals</div>
<div class="content">
<p><br>
The following are the strategic goals of Eclipse.</p>
<ol>
	<li>To define an open development platform. As an open development
	platform, Eclipse provides support for multiple operating environments
	and multiple programming languages. The goal of Eclipse is to define
	for the industry a development platform which is freely licensed, open
	source and provides support for the full breadth of the application
	lifecycle, in many disparate problem domains, across the development
	and deployment platforms of choice.<br>
	<font style="font-size: 3pt"><br>
	</font>At Eclipse, it is not enough to provide an open source
	implementation of developer frameworks and their exemplary tools. The
	frameworks must be architected for extensibility. Doing so enables
	others to more easily build on top of the Eclipse technology.<br>
	<br>
	</li>
	<li>To foster a vibrant open source community well regarded for
	innovation and quality. Since its inception, there has been rapid
	growth in the number of developers working on Eclipse projects. This
	has accelerated since Eclipse has become independent.<br>
	<font style="font-size: 3pt"><br>
	</font>But simply measuring growth in terms of developers and projects
	is not sufficient. Eclipse needs to ensure that it the open source
	projects at Eclipse are building innovative software with a high degree
	of quality.<br>
	<br>
	</li>
	<li>To enable an ecosystem. The creation of a large community of
	commercial and open source organizations which rely on and/or
	complement Eclipse technology has been a major factor in the success of
	Eclipse.<br>
	<font style="font-size: 3pt"><br>
	</font>The high rate of adoption of the Eclipse technology can be
	traced to two key factors: great technology, and the ease with which it
	can be adopted by others, both commercial and open source. This ease of
	adoption has, in turn, several dimensions. The EPL and its CPL
	predecessor provide terms which are conducive to both commercial and
	open source use. The focus on extensible frameworks has made it
	relatively simple to re-use Eclipse Technology.<br>
	<br>
	</li>
	<li>To be ubiquitous. To be considered one of the important development
	platforms. In the limit, Eclipse wants its technology used everywhere,
	by everyone.</li>
</ol>

<div id="section_header"><a name="Eclipse_Future_Directions">Eclipse
Future Directions</a></div>
<div class="content">
<p><br>
The goal of the Roadmap is to provide the Eclipse ecosystem with
guidance and visibility on the future directions of the Eclipse open
source community, and to involve the Eclipse membership in a dialog
about those future directions. In that vein, this section discusses our
current vision of the future as a set of future projects that expand the
value of the ecosystem for all of its members.</p>
<hr>
<p>The following diagram provides an architectural representation of the
Eclipse technology today. The<a href="AC_v2_0/main.html"> Architecture Plan</a>
goes into this in much greater detail.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="AC/arch2.jpg" width="675" height="356">&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p>The <a href="themes.html">Themes and Priorities</a> document prepared
by the Requirements Council describes a number of requirements and focus
areas for the existing Eclipse projects.</p>
<hr>
<p>In addition to the <a href="themes.html">Themes and Priorities</a>
requirements on existing projects in 2006, we envision future growth in
Eclipse projects in the following major areas. These are areas in which
we envision starting new projects in 2006, not areas in which we
envision having completed Eclipse-quality standards-based frameworks and
tooling.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Extend coverage of the software development life-cycle</strong><br>
	<br>
	Eclipse today provides a great deal of coverage of the software
	development lifecycle. Projects such as <img border="0"
		src="PC_v2_0/external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a
		href="http://eclipse.org/emf/">EMF</a>
	support modeling. <img border="0" src="PC_v2_0/external.gif" width="20"
		height="16"><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jdt/index.html">JDT</a>
	and <img border="0" src="PC_v2_0/external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a
		href="http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/">CDT</a> support development and
	debug. <img border="0" src="PC_v2_0/external.gif" width="20"
		height="16"><a
		href="http://www.eclipse.org/test-and-performance/index.html">T</a><a
		href="http://www.eclipse.org/test-and-performance/index.html">est and
	Performance</a> supports QA and post-deployment application monitoring.
	However, Eclipse's goal is to provide <em>complete</em> coverage of the
	software development lifecycle with frameworks and extensible,
	exemplary tools. Some examples of possible new project areas which
	would extend this coverage include: <br>
	<ul>
		<li>requirements management,</li>
		<li>modeling,</li>
		<li>data management,</li>
		<li>deployment, and</li>
		<li>system management.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition, Eclipse will continue to focus on evolving its
frameworks and exemplary tools to meet new development technologies and
runtime environments such as web services and service-oriented
architectures. Support for additional programming languages is also
anticipated. <br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Extend the Rich Client Platform (RCP)</strong><br>
	<br>
	The <img border="0" src="PC_v2_0/external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a
		href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/platform-ui-home/rcp/index.html">RCP</a>
	was introduced by Eclipse with the 3.0 release of the Eclipse Platform
	in June, 2004. The RCP is a technology for building and managing
	applications with a rich user experience. Eclipse's goal is to make the
	RCP a mainstream development platform for both ISVs and enterprise
	developers. To do so, we plan to evolve the RCP technology in the
	following ways: <br>
	<ul>
		<li>Target RCP for additional operating environments. One example of
		this is the eRCP project which is evaluating the use of Eclipse for
		embedded constrained devices such as mobile phones and PDAs.</li>
		<li>Examine alternatives for providing a more complete development for
		creating RCP applications.</li>
		<li>Enhance RCP with new functionality such as better update and
		management capabilities.</li>
		<li>Enhance the security capabilities of the RCP plug-in model.</li>
		<li>Provide application frameworks based on the RCP. <br>
		<br>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Embedded</strong><br>
	<br>
	Eclipse has seen a great deal of success in the embedded marketplace
	over the past several years. For example, CDT has been used by a number
	of RTOS vendors as the basis for their tools platform. But there are
	many different technologies currently not covered by Eclipse which
	would extend to utility of the Eclipse Platform for the embedded
	market. Some examples include: <br>
	<ul>
		<li>Runtime analysis infrastructure to provide frameworks and tools to
		monitor applications running on a device</li>
		<li>Component configuration frameworks and tooling to configure
		operating systems, file systems and middleware</li>
		<li>Target connectivity frameworks to provide mechanisms to connect to
		embedded devices</li>
		<li>Hardware bring-up mechanisms for on-chip debugging and early
		development</li>
		<li>Board design tools <br>
		<br>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Multiple language support</strong><br>
	<br>
	Although Eclipse has been very successful in providing language tools
	for Java and C/C++, doing so still requires a great deal of effort.
	Improving the Eclipse frameworks to provide more consistent APIs for
	plugging in editors, debuggers, build environments, etc. for multiple
	languages is an important goal. There are several different views on
	what multiple language support can mean. Support for compiled
	languages, scripting languages and &quot;Java like&quot; languages such
	as JSP, SQLJ and the like are all related areas where work needs to be
	done. There are numerous trade-offs to be made as well. For example,
	JDT has been highly customized to provide a very rich feature set. Will
	an abstract language toolkit approach meet its needs?<br>
	<br>
	From the perspective of the plug-in providers, there is a lot of
	interest in more easily enabling plug-ins for specialized components
	(debuggers, managed builds, editors) which work across multiple
	languages. Currently if an add-in provider wants to support both CDT
	and JDT separate plug-ins are required. <br>
	<br>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Vertical market technology frameworks</strong><br>
	<br>
	We are seeing interest from vertical market vendors in basing their
	next generation tools on Eclipse. Thus a future growth area for Eclipse
	is to extend our projects to provide open source application frameworks
	and exemplary tools targeted at standards in specific vertical markets
	such as aerospace, automotive, and healthcare.</li>
</ul>
<p>If all of these future directions come to fruition, a future Eclipse
architecture view could be:</p>

<div id="section_header">The Roadmap Process</div>
<div class="content">
<p></p>
<p>The process of creating the Eclipse Roadmap is described in the <img
	border="0" src="PC_v2_0/external.gif" width="20" height="16"><a
	href="../../documents/Eclipse Development Process 2003_11_09 FINAL.pdf">Eclipse
Development Process</a>. The key pieces are</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Creating or updating the Roadmap begins with the Requirements
Council proposing a set of Themes and Priorities that realize the
Purposes and that respond to requirements elicited from the Strategic
Developers, Strategic Consumers, Add-in Providers, and other
constituents of the Ecosystem. After review by the Board of Directors,
these Themes and Priorities are provided as input to the Architecture
Council and the Planning Council. The EMO ensures that the Planning
Council and the Development teams have access to all requirements.
Updates to the Purposes are likely to require updates to the Roadmap and
its associated themes and priorities; proposed Roadmap updates may also
be motivated by new technologies or opportunities.</em></p>
<p><em>The process of producing or updating the Roadmap is expected to
be iterative. An initial set of Themes and Priorities may be infeasible
to implement in the desired timeframe; subsequent consideration may
reveal new implementation alternatives or critical requirements that
alter the team&rsquo;s perspective on priorities. The EMO orchestrates
interaction among and within the three Councils to drive the Roadmap to
convergence.</em></p>
