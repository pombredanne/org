<p><b>Eclipse Test and Performance Tools Platform (TPTP) Project 4.7 Plan</b></p>

<p>TPTP 4.7 is a maintenance release of TPTP 4.6.  As such, no new enhancements are in plan and defect
fixing will be the primary goal of this release. In plan defects can be found in the TPTP bugzilla database. In plan defects will
be targeted to TPTP 4.7 and will have a priority of P1. Each defect will also have a title and a concise summary (usually a single sentence or small paragraph) that explains the work item 
at a suitably high enough level so that everyone can readily understand what the
work item is without having to understand the nitty-gritty detail. </p>

<p>Below you will find the detailed schedule for the TPTP 4.7 deliverable.  Additionally, you will
find the details of its base release - TPTP 4.6. With the previous release, TPTP 4.6.2, as the starting point,
TPTP will address defects, and ensure adequate test coverage, improve documentation, examples, performance 
tuning, usability, etc. TPTP 4.7 will also add support for Eclipse SDK 3.6.

      <p><b>Notes:</b>
It is important to notice that this list of platforms has been significantly reduced from 
previous releases. Based on consumer feedback, several platforms have been stabilized at the 
TPTP 4.3 level, and will remain there with no enhancement plans until there is a larger 
community demand backed by committer resources.</p>

for the TPTP 4.7 release are targeted for general availability on 23-June-2010.  
All release deliverables will be available for download as soon as the release has been tested 
and validated in the target operating configurations.  There is a significant allocation of resource to defect removal in all iterations. 
The first 2 iterations will also contain the bulk of the defect work. The remaining iteration is used to stabilize and shut down the release. 
Every iteration will provide a milestone driver to the Helios release stream.

      <h2>
        <a name="target_environments">Target Environments</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
In order to remain current, each TPTP release targets reasonably current versions of the underlying 
operating environments.</p>
      <ul>
		<li>Java runtime (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.5, and 1.6</li>
		<li><a href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/">Eclipse SDK 3.6</a>
     for Linux GTK, Linux (Motif), or Windows</li>
		<li>Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) SDK <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/downloads/">2.6</a>.</li>
		<li>XML Schema Infoset Model (XSD) SDK <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/downloads/">2.6</a>.</li>
</ul>
      <p>Most of the TPTP SDK is "pure" Java&#8482; code and has no direct dependence
on the underlying operating system.  The chief dependence is therefore on
the Java 2 Platform itself.  The TPTP 4.7 release is written and compiled
against version 1.5 of the Java 2 Platform APIs, and targeted to run on version
1.5 or newer of the Java 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition.</p>
      <p>There are many different implementations of the Java 2 Platform running atop
a variety of operating systems. We focus TPTP testing on a handful of popular combinations of operating system and Java 2 Platform; these are
our reference platforms.  TPTP undoubtedly runs fine in many operating environments
beyond the reference platforms we test.  However, since we do not
systematically test them we cannot vouch for them.  Problems encountered
when running TPTP on non-reference platforms that cannot be recreated on any
reference platform will be given lower priority than problems with running TPTP
on a reference platform.</p>
      <p>Please refer to the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/tptp/home/project_info/releaseinfo/4.6/support.html">
Supported Operating system and JRE document</a> for detailed information on the target
operating environments for TPTP 4.7 release. 
</p>
      <h3>Internationalization</h3>
      <div>
<p>TPTP is designed as the basis for internationalized products. The user
interface elements provided by the TPTP SDK components, including dialogs and
error messages, are externalized. The English strings are provided as the
default resource bundles.</p>

<p>Latin-1 locales are supported by the TPTP SDK on all of the above operating
environments; DBCS locales are supported by the TPTP SDK on the Windows, GTK,
and Motif window systems; BIDI locales are supported by the TPTP SDK only on
Windows operating environments. </p>

<p>The TPTP SDK supports GB 18030, the new Chinese code page standard, on
Windows XP and Linux.</p>

<p>TPTP supports ICU4J starting in 4.2 release. This will significantly
increase the number of supportable locales. Products needing to localize to
newer locales are enabled. German, Traditional Chinese, and Arabic are
tested.</p>

<p>Note that although TPTP support all these languages, only the English
versions of the strings are provided.</p>

        <a name="compatibility">Compatibility with Previous Releases</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        <b>Compatibility with Previous Releases</b>
      </p>
      <p>TPTP 4.7 will be backward compatible with TPTP 4.6.  See <i><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/tptp/home/documents/process/development/api_contract.html">TPTP API Contract</a></i>
 for more information about TPTP APIs.  The following specifies
details of the various aspects of release compatibility.</p>
      <p>
  <strong>API Contract Compatibility:</strong> Refer to <i><a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Evolving_Java-based_APIs">Evolving
Java-based APIs</a></i> for a discussion of the kinds of API
changes that maintain contract compatibility. TPTP SDK
4.7 will be upwards contract-compatible with TPTP SDK 4.6. Downward
contract compatibility is not supported. There is no guarantee that compliance
with TPTP SDK 4.7 APIs would ensure compliance with TPTP SDK 4.5 or lower APIs.
</p>
      <p><strong>Binary (plug-in) Compatibility:</strong> TPTP SDK 4.7 will be upwards binary-compatible with TPTP SDK 4.6. Downward
plug-in compatibility is not supported. Plug-ins for TPTP SDK 4.7 will not be
usable in TPTP SDK 4.6 or lower. Refer to <i><a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Evolving_Java-based_APIs">Evolving
Java-based APIs</a></i> for a discussion of the kinds of API
changes that maintain binary compatibility. 
</p>
      <p><strong>Source Compatibility:</strong> TPTP
SDK 4.7 will be upwards source-compatible with TPTP SDK 4.6. This means that
source files written to use TPTP SDK 4.6 APIs might successfully compile and
run against TPTP SDK 4.7 APIs, although this is not guaranteed. Downward source
compatibility is not supported. If source files use new TPTP SDK APIs, they
will not be usable with an earlier version of the TPTP SDK.  
</p>
      <p><strong>Workspace Compatibility:</strong> TPTP SDK 4.7 will be upwards workspace-compatible with TPTP SDK 4.6 unless
noted. This means that workspaces and projects created with TPTP SDK 4.6 can be
successfully opened by TPTP SDK 4.6 and upgraded to a 4.6 workspace. This
includes both hidden metadata, which is localized to a particular workspace, as
well as metadata files found within a workspace project (e.g., the .project
file), which may propagate between workspaces via file copying or team repositories.
Downward workspace compatibility is not supported. A workspace created (or
opened) by a product based on TPTP 4.6 will be unusable with a product based an
earlier version of TPTP. Visible metadata files created (or overwritten) by
TPTP 4.6 will generally be unusable with earlier versions of TPTP.
</p>
      <p><strong>Non-compliant usage of API's:</strong> All non-API methods and classes, and
certainly everything in a package with "internal" or "provisional" in its name,
are considered implementation details which may vary between operating
environment and are subject to change without notice. Client plug-ins that
directly depend on anything other than what is specified in the TPTP SDK API are 
inherently unsupportable and receive no guarantees about compatibility within a single 
release much less with an earlier releases. Refer to 
<i><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-API%20use/eclipse-API-usage-rules.html">How
to Use the Eclipse API</a></i> for information about how to write
compliant plug-ins and <i><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/tptp/home/documents/process/development/api_contract.html">TPTP API Contract</a></i>
 for more information about internal and provisional TPTP APIs.</p>

      <h2>
        <a name="themes_and_priorities">Themes and Priorities</a>
      </h2>
      <div>
<p>The TPTP PMC adopted and specialized the
following Eclipse themes which represented the key focus areas for the TPTP 4.6 release that was delivered earlier.
TPTP 4.7 is an ongoing maintenance stream of this earlier deliverable and additionally supports Eclipse SDK 3.6.</p>
    </div>
      <h3>Scaling Up</h3>
      <p>
TPTP continued to enhance the support
of large data volumes and processing rates in areas such as data collection,
user interface and in the persistence of trace, log and statistical models and
execution histories. 
      </p>
      <h3>Enterprise Ready</h3>
      <p>
Changes to the data collection layers increased
interoperability with enterprise security infrastructure. In addition, there
was progressive adoption of the TPTP tools and infrastructure as a test
platform for the project itself, which in turn drove refinements
into the tools. An increased focus on whole-project integration testing 
ensured effective interoperability amongst all TPTP components and the rest of
the Eclipse environment. 
      </p>
      <h3>Design for Extensibility: Be a Better Platform</h3>
      <p>
There were a wide range of activities within TPTP to
externalize APIs and define extension points, making the infrastructure more
flexible and more generic in application. A good example of this was the integration
of TPTP with WTP and BIRT for web application testing, profiling and generation
of customized reports of results. 
      </p>
      <h3>Embedded Development</h3>
      <p>
TPTP target execution environment and remote data collection framework provided
capabilities that were adapted for high-end embedded systems. 
      </p>
      <h3>Simple to Use</h3>
      <p>
Previously existing TPTP tools were conceived as samples, rather than as exemplary, and so they
were deficient in many areas of usability and in some cases lacking in function.
      </p>
      <h3>Appealing to the Broader Community</h3>
      <p>
A range of initiatives were undertaken to broaden the community
of potential and actual users of TPTP. Technically this included additional
integration of open source test tool technologies based on JUnit, and the
various hooks to JUnit in the JDT, more data collection agents &#8211;
particularly focusing on open source technologies, and additional operating
system and hardware platforms from which data can be collected.

      <h2>
        <a name="appendix">Appendix Projects</a>
      </h2>
      <p>The TPTP top-level project 
comprises four projects, managed in a coordinated fashion, across which 
plan items are allocated. TPTP projects include:</p>
      <ul>
  <li><b>TPTP Platform Project </b> - Provides common infrastructure in the areas of user interface, EMF based data
models, data collection and communications control, as well as remote execution
environments. Additionally, the Platform provides extension points for
leveraging or extending these capabilities in solution specific tooling or
runtimes. This includes Eclipse workbench plug-ins as well as runtime plug-ins
on a target and optionally remote system.</li>
  <li><b>Testing Tools Project </b> - Provides specializations of the TPTP Platform for testing (e.g. test editors,
trace/test conversion support), and exemplary extensible tools for specific
testing environments. Initially this includes three test environments: JUnit,
JUnit Plug-in, and URL testing. These specializations provide optimized editing and
reporting experiences for these use cases. In the cases where a unique runtime
or an implementation of a testability interface is required, it is also
developed in the project.</li>
  <li><b>Tracing &amp; Profiling Tools
Project</b> - Extends the TPTP Platform with specific data collection for Java
and distributed applications that populate the common trace model, additional
language and protocol support is anticipated. There are also viewers and
analysis services that draw data from the common trace model. Capabilities are
provided to collect and analyze heap and stack information as well as generic
toolkits for instrumenting running applications.</li>
   <li><b>Monitoring Tools Project </b>- Although now in AS-IS mode, TPTP continues to provide the
TPTP Monitoring Tools Project to the open source community for those users wishing to extend the TPTP 
Platform for collecting, analyzing, aggregating, and visualizing data that can be captured
in the log and statistical models. The typical examples are the collection of
system or application resources such as CPU or memory utilization and support
for the viewing, aggregation, and analysis of that data. Logs can also be transformed
into a common format and model allowing for symptom and pattern analysis. The
correlation of the data in these models is of particular interest when it is
associated with other model instances of statistical or log data as well as
traces and tests.</li>

      </h2>
      <p>In TPTP 4.7 the focus will be on the reduction of the
defect backlog. Defects are prioritized based on severity, age, and resource
availability. We encourage users to report defects and we will do our best to
fix them in priority order. The goal is resolve as many of the major/critical/blocker
defects as possible.</p>
