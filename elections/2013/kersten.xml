		<p>Eclipse has matured and cemented its role as a platform for innovation.  As its Sustaining Members, we play a key role in driving the direction of Eclipse.  Our contributions in the form of code, evangelism, as well as Eclipse-based products and services have made Eclipse the vibrant multi-vendor ecosystem that it is today.</p>

		<p>In joining Eclipse as one of the first non-IBM committers, I've been engaged with both the technology community and commercialization aspects of Eclipse since the outset in 2001. For the past year I have been your representative on the Eclipse Board of directors, previously served as committer representative, lead the now top-level Mylyn project, and am currently serving on the Architecture and Planning Councils.</p>

		<p>I've worked directly with many Solution Member companies and watched some Eclipse business models flourish while others have failed. Starting a profitable company around Eclipse has given me a pragmatic perspective on how to participate in the platform while growing both product and service revenues on Eclipse-based offerings. For the past year I served as your representative on the Eclipse board, and for this next year I plan on continuing to apply my experience and ongoing dialog with members in order to help make your Eclipse-based efforts successful.</p>

		<p>Succeeding in Eclipse means striking a balance between the member, committer and user communities.  As your board representative, my priorities will be to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Facilitate reaching users:</b> Marketing in a vendor-neutral open source ecosystem can be far from obvious, and reaching the very broad Eclipse user base is needed for both the commercial success of members and of Eclipse as a whole.  I have been closely involved in <a target="_blank" href="http://tasktop.com/blog/eclipse/growing-open-source-ecosystems-install">improving the install story</a> for Eclipse solutions and the upcoming <a target="_blank" href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=296131">Eclipse Marketplace</a> client.  These efforts will provide the next generation of opportunities to get your solution into Eclipse users' hands.</li>
				<li><b>Lower the barrier to engaging with projects:</b> With product releases and other pressures, too often the step of getting directly involved with an Eclipse project that you build on does not make the cost/benefit cut.  But not getting involved has the longer-term cost of incompatibilities and overhead.  Lowering the bar for direct participation will provide members with better access to the collaboration and contributor community that make Eclipse a great open source ecosystem.  On the Mylyn project we have had over 900 bugs and feature requests resolved by community contributions.  I will use my experience of making this work for Mylyn to help lower the overhead of participation with existing projects so that similar benefits are accessible to more members.</li>
				<li><b>Listen to members:</b> My job will be to represent your needs on the board, and I will work with the other representatives to actively seek out feedback from all Solution Members.  I helped make the needs of individual committers heard as a committer representative on the Eclipse board, and will ensure that your needs are represented in discussions and decisions made at the board level.</li>
			</ul>
		
		<p>We made good progress on these priorities in the past year, and I hope to continue representing you and helping you make the most out of your investment and engagement in Eclipse in 2011.</p>
