<eclipse_affiliation> <![CDATA[As one of your current Add-in Provider 
(AIP) Board members I've strongly supported the interests of our 
community for the past two years and would be honored to represent you again in 
2008. 2007 was a very active year in the Eclipse Community and on the board. I won't bore you with details (if you want to read the board meeting minutes check out http://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/minutes.php) but will say that I was a strong advocate for our AIP community. During the year I lead Eclipse Market Research and the Advertising Working Groups, both important to the continued success of Eclipse. My team and I at Instantiations supported many Eclipse-related activities in 2007 including EclipseCon, open source projects, demo camps, webinars, committees and more. We're all very involved and committed to the success of the technology and the community. Instantiations has made the Eclipse platform the core of its strategy and is <i> all Eclipse all the time.</i>

<vision> <![CDATA[<p>My vision for 2008 is to:</p><ul>

at Eclipse Board meetings during 2008.</li>
<li>Continue to increase ROI for Add-in Provider membership in the 
Eclipse Foundation.</li>
<li>Make Eclipse a powerful "profitability platform" for Add-in providers.</li>
<li>...and of course, to assure that Eclipse technology remains the 
best on the planet!</li>
