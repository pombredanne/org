	<vision>  <![CDATA[My vision for Eclipse:
                <p>
		Making Eclipse a long-term success based on a broad community and a successful ecosystem. 
		Eclipse is a fantastic success story built on great technology and Open Source - and as well 
		on the broad number of large and 
		small companies that support it. It will be pivotal for the long term success of Eclipse to foster business adoption 
                as well as technological excellence. We need to be agile not only on the development side, 
                but as well in steadily improving the Eclipse Foundation and the ecosystem.</p>
		<p>
                My three most important objectives:
		<ul>
    		<li>Building the Ecosystem ï¿½ strive for providing more value to membership (e.g. 
		market data, member section on eclipse.org). Help to develop better networking and 
		collaboration between members. Engage with members to provide success stories, 
		use cases.</li>
    		<li>Represent and promote the business interests of the Add-In Providers at the board, most 
		of them small to medium sized companies</li>
    		<li>Leverage an European based board representation to help add-in providers in an successful 
		and rapidly growing European market.</li>
		</p>
		<p>Please contact me if you have any questions.</p>]]>
