	<p>If I would be elected as your representative I'd like to actively participate in this role and take care that 
	your requests and opinions are well recognized and presented in the Eclipse Board of Directors.</p>
	<p>
        In my current job I�m also a member of a Project Management Circle and responsible for analyzing and reviewing established 
	development processes and tools. One goal of this circle is to harmonize the different tools, isolated applications and 
	isolated processes grown over years in different teams and departments. Based on the experiences gathered in this circle 
	and my background in software development processes and developing and contributing to Eclipse I�d like to start a review 
	of the tools involved into your daily work and hosted by the Eclipse Foundation. </p>
	<p>
        I don�t want to rapidly change any tools or underlying processes. I want to collect your pain and discuss any issues you 
	have with the tools or the processes with you and the board. If possible and desirable there will be a smooth evolution of 
	existing and well established tools.  For example, I recently opened bug 121703 (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=121703) 
	to start a discussion about the Bugzilla customization strategy. And if there is a need for a new tool, I�ll make sure that 
	you will get the best tool available that integrates as smart as possible in your daily work.</p>
	<p>
        My work will be transparent and open for you. I�ll will blog about my activities and inform you about results and points we discussed.</p>
