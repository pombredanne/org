		<p>Serving as an Sustaining Member Representative on the Board of Directors of the 
		Eclipse Foundation in my third term, I see ongoing challenges and opportunities 
		for the Eclipse Ecosystem:
		</p>		
		<p>
		While Eclipse needs to maintain its leading position in the Java IDE and runtime world, it is necessary 
		to open up the Eclipse ecosystem for new technologies. During my term as a Board member, I supported 
		every proposal and resolution that opens up Eclipse to non-Java projects and I plan to 
		continue to do so in the future. The core strength of the Eclipse Foundation (managed IP progress, 
		well governed open source projects) should be applicable to any serious open source project with 
		commercial attitude. I also support the idea of cooperating with other open source communities to 
		help users to easily integrate the "best of all worlds" software components.
		</p>
		<p>
		My vision for the Eclipse membership model is to generate more tangible membership value for 
		small and mid-sized companies (committers and consumers), while keeping the large companies 
		interested in staying in the Foundation. The "long term support" initiative and the industry 
		working groups are good examples for increased member value. I will support future 
		initiatives for industry working groups and hope that these groups help to grow the community 
		and make the Eclipse Foundation financially robust - so we all can benefit from using Eclipse 
		software in the future. I also want to work on a program that activates the quiet community members to 
		more actively participate in the development of the ecosystem and the Foundation. 
		</p>

		Hans Kamutzki is co-founder and Managing Director of MicroDoc, Munich. 
		He studied Physics and Computer Science in Bonn and Munich, Germany and focused on realtime image 
		processing and process control in the early days of his professional work. For a "device and algorithm 
		for the automatic detection of objects" he was co-awarded a German and European patent. After many 
		years of development and project management practice in Smalltalk and Java, Hans now runs the 
		Embedded Java operations at MicroDoc.

		MicroDoc is a software consultancy and product development business founded in 1991 by Hendrik Hoefer and 
		Hans Kamutzki. In the 90s, MicroDoc's focus was on object oriented programming with Smalltalk. Hans Kamutzki 
		was a main contributor to a MicroDoc product called "Objects for Notes," a technical Smalltalk to Lotus Notes gateway 
		that was licensed to IBM in 1995. He worked as a technical and operational liaison between MicroDoc and IBM and spent 
		several months with integration work in the RTP labs in Raleigh, NC and on other lab engagements. Even before 
		Java became mainstream, MicroDoc invested in this technology and provided a number of product components to 
		the international market of reusable components. Among these products are Java based persistence frameworks, 
		an EJB persistency container and a variety of migration and quality assurance tools as well as some contributions 
		to IBM's VisualAge for Java product. MicroDoc's work with Eclipse started in 2002 with an IDE migration project for a 
		large airline. Eclipse has become a universal tool within MicroDoc since then. Eclipse is used as a development platform, 
		but also heavily as a runtime environment for RCP and eRCP clients and server applications. As MicroDoc is building 
		end-to-end solutions (starting on the mainframe and scaling down to mobile and embedded devices), the Eclipse RCP/eRCP platforms are 
		essential building blocks for harmonizing the architecture in many MicroDoc projects today. As a Managing Director, Hans is in 
		charge of the embedded Java business as well as legal and contractual matters within MicroDoc today.
