	<p>My various career steps have always been guided by a true passion for new technologies that can have a major impact on our markets. It has been my conviction since the early stage of its foundation that Eclipse would be one of these, and I am excited about adding my contribution to the realm. I will dedicate it to helping Add-in Providers, especially European ones, strengthen the prominence of Eclipse in various verticals where they can offer unique differentiators and compelling contributions, while leveraging the huge Eclipse pull for members.</p>
