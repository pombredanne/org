    The Eclipse community has been tremendously successful in attracting talent and
    growing in different areas, but we are experiencing some growing pains. One
    of the problems that I have seen come up frequently while working on the
    Web Tools Platform is the lack of an effective vehicle for sharing common
    code between Eclipse projects. Typically, the only way for code to get shared
    is to "push it down" to the Eclipse Platform. The platform team is naturally 
    reluctant to see their project become the dumping ground for any code that 
    two or more projects wish to share, so we end up solving the same problem
    over and over again. Not only does it hurt everyone's productivity, but it
    impacts the user experience. We need a novel approach to tackle this problem.
    I'd like to see us develop a system where it is fairly easy to create micro
    components that developers from multiple projects can collaborate on.

    I am a software developer with BEA Systems and have been a committer on the
    Web Tools Platform since its first release. I have designed and implemented
    the Faceted Project Framework which made it possible for people to easily
    extend capabilities of WTP projects. In my prior life, I have worked on 
    compilers, custom servers and network protocol design. I have graduated from 
    the University of Washington with BS in Computer Science.
