         In early 2002 Tracy started hearing about the "Eclipse Project"
         from a few of the Openmake developers. She took a closer look and was immediately
         surprised by what she found, an open source effort focused around a common IDE
         platform.  By the end of 2002, Tracy had become a "founding steward" of this new and 
         exciting community, and the first women on the board.  Tracy has been a very active 
         member of Eclipse always adding her "2 cents" along the way.  Some of you may know her
         from her involvement in early marketing efforts such as the JavaOne show floor games,
         t-shirts, Eclipse logo designs as well as technical involvement in the
         heated debates regarding Swing vs. SWT. Others may know Catalyst Systems through their 
         involvement in the ALF project.  Tracy's experience working with the Eclipse community
         for the last 5 years has given her a strong understanding of how an Add-in Provider
         can benefit by getting involved in this very dynamic organization.

        Involvement with Eclipse from Add-in Provider companies is a critical
        component of the overall success of Eclipse.  Some Add-in Providers have learned 
        how to stay involved even as Eclipse has grown.  I believe there are many more
        Add-in Providers who want to be active, not passive, members of Eclipse but simply
        don't know how. Add-in Providers need to be better organized so that they can more
        easily see how to get involved.  This may be done by simply adding an
        "Add-in Provider Help Wanted" page on the Eclipse web site. In addition, Add-in
        providers need to be recognized as a core pillar of Eclipse. This can be done
        through better recognition programs for active Add-in Providers and an increased
        focus on Add-in Providers through Public Relations contacts.  Add-in Provider 
        contribution is important.  What we don't want is for the Eclipse organization
        to evolve to a place where Add-in Providers simply serve as an audience to the
        Strategic Members.  We are the "members at large" and represent one of the core 
        pillars of this organization.

Tracy has had extensive experience in the development and implementation 
        of business applications. She began her consulting career in 1989 consulting to
        fortune 500 organizations in the areas of testing, configuration management and
        build management. It was during her consulting experiences that Tracy recognized
        the lack of build management procedures for the distributed platform that had
        long been considered standard on the mainframe. This lead her to co-found Catalyst
        Systems in 1995 and the creation of Openmake, one of the first commerical enterprise build
        management tools on the market and the only build management tool that offers developers
        a reusable solution for scripting builds. Tracy served as the CEO of Catalyst Systems 
        for 12 years.She has a Bachelor of Science Degree from California Polytechnic
	University, Pomona, CA.
