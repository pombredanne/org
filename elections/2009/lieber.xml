<p>I am excited to get involved with Eclipse's growing roster of projects. Solution members, such as Webtide, cover extremely diverse technologies, projects, markets, and business models. As a representative of the group, I will work to promote help at the board level for their needs in project, business, marketing, and technology development.</p>

<p>The new inclusion of the runtime project is a great mechanism to provide more and better facilities for users and developers of Eclipse technologies. With Webtide's long experience in open source runtime technologies such as Jetty, we would also like to help along the integration of those technologies with development tools, and make sure that each group of users and developers from tooling and runtime understand how to make each other's lives easier and and their project integrations maintainable. I will also work to promote the recognition of Eclipse brand both for its IDE an runtime technologies.</p>
