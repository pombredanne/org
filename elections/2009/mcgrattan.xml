	<vision>  In the current economic crisis it becomes more important than ever to ensure that Eclipse members, regardless of membership class, understand the value that their Eclipse membership provides to them. 
My vision for the next year is that we more effectively communicate the benefits to those we represent; identify the messages that resonate and assist the EMO in maintaining the current membership level. 
I will use communication channels like my blog, speaking engagements at conferences as well as emails as communication tools. </vision>
