	<vision>  <![CDATA[The Eclipse ecosystem has remarkable diversity, both in 
	technologies provided and  members involved. Crucial to the continuing 
	success of Eclipse is a delicate balance where all interests are appropriately 
	considered. As a Sustaining Member Board representative, I will help ensure 
	that the issues important to the larger membership are considered in equal 
	footing with the agenda of Strategic members. The Board needs to enable 
	competition on a common platform for all members, and experienced Sustaining 
	membership Board representation is a vital component for realizing this aim.]]>
