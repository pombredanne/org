My vision for Eclipse in 2009 is to encourage more contact between European and American members. The growth of the Eclipse community on both sides of the Atlantic is a great opportunity for member companies and individuals to network and share ideas. As a representative based in Europe I can collect and present ideas from a European perspective as well as communicating other ideas back to the members in Europe. The issues and questions of European members play an important role in moving Eclipse on as a platform and as a community. I would like to be the point-of-contact for both sides to bring us closer together.
