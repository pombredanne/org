MicroDoc is a Eclipse add-in memeber for many years and Eclipse is a core element of MicroDoc's company strategy. Hans 
currently serves as an Sustaining Member Representative on the Board of Directors of the Eclipse Foundation. He was also 
elected to be a member of the Eclipse Finance Commitee.

<p>Serving as an Sustaining Member Representative on the Board of Directors of the Eclipse Foundation for almost a year now, I 
see a number of significant challenges to the Eclipse Ecosystem.</p>

<p>Membership: A limited number of large corporations pay most of the Eclipse budget for strategic reasons. The current 
membership model makes it hard for many (smaller) companies to justify payment of the membership fees to the Eclipse 
foundation ("why pay for something we can get for free anyway?"). In my vision for Eclipse, the membership model 
is updated to generate more immediate membership value for a large number of small and mid sized companies (committers and consumers).
This would make the Eclispe foundation more robust against economical threads caused be large member strategy changes. 
The model for representation of members on the Board of Directors will have to be adapted in case of increased membership, 
to ensure that the board can still function well and effective.</p>

<p>Visibility and representation: The Eclispe foundation is a well governed and efficient organization. Running the 
EMO is a full time job for the director, which leaves little time for public representation. 
Im my vision for Eclipse, the foundation will designate a dedicated evangelist whose sole responsibility is to 
publicly represent the Eclipse in the software community and beyond.</p>

<p>JDT: In my vision for Eclipse, JDT still plays a fundamental role and will be maintained by a structured community effort.</p> 

<p>In my opinion, the board is not a place for personal image cultivation or self expression, but for steering the 
directions of community of developers who support a multi-million base of users.
In this spirit, I'd like to represent the Sustaining Members for another term.</p>

MicroDoc is a software consultancy and product development business founded in 1991 by Hendrik Hoefer and 
Hans Kamutzki. In the 90s, MicroDoc's focus was on object oriented programming with Smalltalk. Hans Kamutzki 
was a main contributor to a MicroDoc product called "Objects for Notes", a technical Smalltalk to Lotus Notes gateway 
that was licensed to IBM in 1995. He worked as a technical and operational liaison between MicroDoc and IBM and spent 
several months with integration work in the RTP labs in Raleigh, NC and on other lab engagements. Even before 
Java became mainstream, MicroDoc invested in this technology and provided a number of product components to 
the international market of reusable components. Among these products are Java based persistence frameworks, 
an EJB persistency container and a variety of migration and quality assurance tools as well as some contributions 
to IBM's VisualAge for Java product. MicroDoc's work with Eclipse started in 2002 with an IDE migration project for a 
large airline. Eclipse has become a universal tool within MicroDoc since then. Eclipse is used as a development platform, 
but also heavily as a runtime environment for RCP and eRCP clients and server applications. As MicroDoc is building end to 
end solutions (starting on the mainframe and scaling down to mobile and embedded devices), the Eclipse RCP/eRCP platforms are 
essential building blocks for harmonizing the architecture in many MicroDoc projects today. As a Managing Directory, Hans is in 
charge for the embedded Java business as well as legal and contractual matters within MicroDoc today.
