 <P><UL>
Made his first major open source contribution over a decade ago by writing the GNU C++ compiler, the first native-code C++ compiler and debugger. His early work created world-leading technologies and also informed the first open source business model. In 1989, Tiemann  co-founded Cygnus Solutions, the first company to provide commercial support for open source software. Tiemann serves on a number of boards, including the Open Source Initiative, the Embedded Linux Consortium, the GNOME Foundation, the Jabber Technical Advisory Board, the Board of Directors of ActiveState Tool Corp and Eclipse.org.</UL></P>
