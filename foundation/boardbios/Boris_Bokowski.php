Boris works for Google in Munich, Germany. He is a member of the
Eclipse Architecture Council, and a committer on the Platform UI, e4,
and Orion projects. He is proud to have helped increase diversity at
the Eclipse Platform (a little) by attracting several outside
contributors and helping them become committers. Before joining Google
in 2011, he worked on Eclipse for IBM in Ottawa, Canada for six years,
wrote a commercial RCP app using EMF and GEF, co-founded and
co-managed a Web 2.0 company in Germany, worked on the original
Eclipse 1.0 at OTI in Ottawa, and earned a PhD in computer science at
Freie Universitat Berlin, Germany. He is married and a geek dad of
three kids. You can find him on IRC as "borisb6i".
