Boris is the technical lead of the Eclipse Platform UI component and works for IBM in Ottawa, Canada. He is a
member of the Eclipse Architecture Council, and an active committer on the e4 project. He is proud to have
helped increase diversity at the Eclipse Platform (a little) by attracting several non-IBM contributors and
helping them become committers. Before joining IBM in 2005, he wrote a commercial RCP app using EMF and GEF,
co-founded and co-managed a Web 2.0 company in Germany, worked on the original Eclipse 1.0 at OTI in Ottawa,
and earned a PhD in computer science at Freie Universitat Berlin, Germany. He is married and a geek dad of
three kids. You can find him on IRC as "borisb6i".
