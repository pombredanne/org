      <h4>Add-in Provider Requirements Session</h4>
      <p>Todd Williams and Rich Main (Eclipse Add-in Provider Board Representatives) 
        lead a session to develop a list of themes and priorities from the perspective 
        of the Add-in Provider community. This list will be used as input into 
        the Requirements Council.</p>
      <p>The process followed to develop the list of themes and priorities was as 
        follows:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rich Main led a brainstorming session to identify potential topics for break-out groups. 8 topics were identified:
          <br>          
          <ul>
            <li>Abstract Language Developer Toolkit</li>
            <li>Business Intelligence and Reporting</li>
            <li>Embedded</li>
            <li>Marketing</li>
            <li>Rich Client Platform</li>
            <li>Testing and Performance</li>
            <li>Web Tools Project<br>
                                                                        </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Two sets of four break-out groups were given 1 hour to develop a list of requirements for the given topic. Each attendee could select which break-out group they would participate in.        </li>
        <li>All the break-out groups reported back and presented their list of requirements.</li>
        <li>Each person was allowed to vote on their priority requirements. The process of voting was done by allowing each attendee 25 points that could be allocated across all the different requirements. All the votes were then tabulated to come up with the final list of priorities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The prioritized list is as follows:</p>

        <li>Testing - need a universal client</li>
        <li>Deployment to local and remote servers</li>
        <li>TPTP/ Hyades should abstract ways to do tracing of hardware (at chip level), not just software tracing</li>
        <li>TPTP/ Hyades should look at monitoring of deployed embedded systems (in addition to enterprise)</li>
        <li>DT should abstract debugging more for hardware capabilities</li>
