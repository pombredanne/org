		<description>
			Wayne is the Director of Open Source Projects at the Eclipse Foundation. 
			He spends his days working with the many Eclipse projects, learning about 
			Eclipse technology, and making sure that everybody knows just how cool it 
			all really is. Wayne is also the editor-in-chief of Eclipse Corner, PMC 
			member of the Mylyn, Technology, and TPTP Projects, Project Lead for the 
			Dash, Examples, and Woolsey Projects, and an advisor for osbootcamp. In 
			1982, he received the prestigious Chief Scouts Award from then-Governor 
			General Edward Schreyer. In 1984 his team was selected to represent 
			beautiful British Columbia in the Kinsmen Voyageur Relay. In his spare 
			time, he writes down meaningless accomplishments from his youth in a 
			lame attempt to impress the reader.
