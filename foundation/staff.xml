		<description> <![CDATA[ While striving to be a Renaissance Man, Bjorn keeps falling back into

			href="http://www.juggling.org/">juggling</A> and <A 
			href="http://www.eaa.org/">general aviation</A>. His escape attempts have been 
			through <A href="http://www.orienteering.org/">orienteering</A>, <A 
			href="http://www.bta4bikes.org/">bicycling</A>, <A 
			href="http://www.friendsoftrees.org/">planting trees</A> and <A 
			href="http://www.superboy.org/images/superboy.jpg">painting his airplane</A>. He 
			is passionate about doing things instead of just talking about them, and he 
			thoroughly enjoys the <A href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/">annual party</A> he 
			helps organize for the Eclipse community.

			<![CDATA[Despite her official title at the Portland office, Anne prefers being known as the Third Person, with the role of making Person One and Person Two (Bjorn and Ward) more effective. When not in front of a monitor, Anne prefers activities that involve wearing a helmet--horseback riding, skiing, and (fair-weather) cycling. One of her favorite books is The Chicago Manual of Style, so if you need help with the nitpicking details of writing in English, she's happy to help.]]>
